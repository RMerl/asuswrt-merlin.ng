Asuswrt-Merlin 3006.xxx Changelog
=================================

3006.102.7 (xx-xxx-2026)
  - NOTE: AiCloud has been removed from Asuswrt-Merlin due
          to its poor security track record.  This also includes
          cloud syncing features such as Asuswebstorage or
          Dropbox syncing with USB folder.  Use a VPN if you
          need secure remote access to your data.

  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 102_40399 (GT-BE19000AI only)
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.17.
  - UPDATED: Dropbear to 2025.89.

           CVE-2025-69421, CVE-2026-22795 and CVE-2026-22796
           (backports by RSDNTWK)
  - FIXED: Missing UPnP settings on models with multiservice
           WAN support.
  - REMOVED: AiCloud support, due to security reasons.


3006.102.6 (25-Nov-2025)
  - NOTE: Asus has made some security related changes.  Password
          requirements are stricter, and UPNP is no longer
          enabled by default.  New password rules were
          slightly loosened for Asuswrt-Merlin, repeating
          characters are still allowed.
  - NOTE: For developers, the Tomato legacy files (tm*.*)
          are no longer included with the webui.  Please
          update your addon pages accordingly.

  - NEW: Added support for the RT-BE58_Go.
  - NEW: Added support for the GT-BE19000AI.
  - NEW: Redesigned Traffic Monitor pages.
         - Uses Chart.js for Realtime and Last24 pages
         - Removes legacy Tomato code
         - Last 24 can be zoomed in and panned (mouse wheel
           and pinch-to-zoom gestures are both supported)
         - Realtime and Last 24 now show as bits/s instead
           of bytes/s
         - Settings moved from the tab to the dropdown menu
         - Removed NVRAM database location option and added
           JFFS.  Also removed rarely used start-of-month
           setting.

  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 38978 (RT-BE58_GO only)
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 40103 (GT-BE19000AI only)
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 39099 (other Wifi 7 models)
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 37351 (Wifi 6 models)
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.16.
  - UPDATED: libcap-ng to 0.8.4 (to be in sync with upstream)
  - CHANGED: TrafficMonitor stats can now be saved to JFFS,
             and removed support for saving to NVRAM.
  - REMOVED: outdated setuprsa.sh script.
  - FIXED: IPv6 requests for prefix lengths other than 64 for
           routers with Multiwan support.
  - FIXED: CVE-2025-9230 in OpenSSL (backport by RSDNTWK).
  - FIXED: Client name would be missing on the Wireless Log
           page if the MAC was missing in the DHCP lease list
           (for static clients for example)
  - FIXED: OpenSSL 1.1.1 would prioritize CHACHA20 over AES
           on BCM4916 devices
  - FIXED: MU-MIMO couldn't be disabled on some models.


3006.102.5 (3-Aug-2025)
  - NOTE: For developers, please note that the new default branch
          is now called "main" - it's what was previously the
          3006.102 branch.
          The "master" branch has been renamed "master-old", and
          is no longer actively used.  Due to how the 3006.102
          branch diverged, it was easier to do it this way than
          to fold back 3006.102 on top of master.

  - NEW: Completely redesigned System Log -> Connections page.
           - You can now filter the list
           - You can set the page to auto-refresh itself
           - Public IP addresses can be looked up on
             WhatismyIPaddress.com
           - Local hostnames will be resolved and shown
           - Routed IPv6 connections will be shown

  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 3006.102_36957 for Wifi 6 devices.
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 3006.102_38757 for WIfi 7 devices.
  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2025.88.
  - CHANGED: Replaced netstat-nat by a fork called netstat-nat-ng.
             This fork fixes a number of issues with IPv6 and
             field size.
  - CHANGED: Updated Control-D DoT server entries (dave14305).
  - CHANGED: Optimized performance when refreshing the Sysinfo
             page on a network with thousands of tracked
             connections.
  - CHANGED: Modified the Quick Internet Setup wizard so not
             to attempt downloading firmware updates from Asus
             (which would fail anyway).
  - FIXED: OpenVPN server set to "Internet only" would fail to
           block LAN access (invalid firewall rule from SDN was
           bypassing it).
  - FIXED: DNSDirector "Router" mode would not always work properly
           with IPv6 (now uses REDIRECT instead of DNAT, which was
           backported from iptables 1.4.19).
  - FIXED: DNSDirector would try to create iptables rules even
           when that SDN should not allow DNSDirector if it shares
           the main LAN interface.  This could break DNSDirector
           on the main network.
  - FIXED: Status frame missing from Network Map when accessing
           the router under certain hostnames.
  - FIXED: Wireless Settings page failing to save on some models
           when in an AiMesh setup.


3006.102.4 (10-May-2025)
  - NOTE: If migrating from a 3004 firmware, only the first Guest
          Network will be migrated - any additionnal GN must be
          manually reconfigured.
  - NOTE: If migrating from a 3004 firmware, the Wireless Scheduler
          will need to be manually reconfigured if you were using
          it.
  - NOTE: As a reminder, the ROG variant of the webui is not
          supported in the 3006 firmware series, as maintaining
          two separate interfaces is too much extra work.
  - NOTE: Due to numerous webui changes, it's recommended to
          force refresh the page after first login, or clear
          your browser cache.

  - NEW: Moved RT-AX86U_PRO, RT-AX88U_PRO, ZenWifi Pro XT12,
         GT-AX6000, GT-AXE16000 and GT-AX11000_PRO to the
         3006 firmware series.
  - NEW: Added RT-BE92U support, based on GPL 102_37526.
  - NEW: Added Control-D servers to DNS-over-TLS
         presets (dave14305)
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 3006.102_36521 for Wifi 6 models (Wifi 7
             devices other than the RT-BE92U are still on
             102_37346).
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.14.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.3.8.
  - UPDATED: amtm to 5.2 (decoderman)
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.91.
  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2025.87.
  - CHANGED: Setting DNS Director to "Router" will now always
             redirect to the router's own IP.  Previously it
             would redirect to the first DNS server configured
             on the DHCP page (which defaults to the router
             itself).
             If you need DNS Director to redirect to an IP
             configured in your DHCP settings, use a Custom DNS
             entry in DNS Director.  This makes it more consistant
             with what the name implies, and was also necessary
             for improved Guest Network support.
  - CHANGED: Tools category renamed System Info.
  - CHANGED: Tools -> Other Settings were moved to new tabs
             (Administration -> Tweaks, and
             Traffic Analyzer -> Settings).
  - CHANGED: Moved "Redirect to asusrouter.com " to the new
             Tweaks tab, and moved "Enable JFFS Custom Scripts"
             to the Basic Config section on the System page.
  - FIXED: Missing hostname on Wireless Log for MLO-capable Wifi 7
           clients.
  - FIXED: CVE-2024-9143 in OpenSSL (Debian backport by RSDNTWK)
  - FIXED: CVE-2024-13176 in OpenSSL (Ubuntu backport by RSDNTWK)
  - FIXED: Guest Networks on an isolated VLAN with DNS Director set
           to "Router" would fail to do any name resolution (both
           for whole network and for specific clients).
  - FIXED: Wrong tab selected when clicking on "Profile" on the
           VLAN page (dave14305)
  - FIXED: Missing button to remove entries in the Offline Client
           List (dave14305)
  - FIXED: CVE-2025-2492 in AiCloud (backport from upstream)
  - FIXED: DoT access wasn't properly blocked when appropriate
           for Guest Networks.
  - FIXED: DNS-over-TLS presets overwritten by Asus' own (dave14305)
  - FIXED: Networkmap system status frame failing to load when
           accessing the router with some particular hostnames.
  - FIXED: Missing option to disable logging of DHCP/RA queries.


3006.102.3 (11-Jan-2025)
  - NOTE: If flashing on top of Asus stock firmware 3006.102_37000
          or greater, then you first need to enable downgrade
          capabilities before flashing Asuswrt-Merlin on top
          of it.  Connect Over SSH, and run the following command:

             nvram set DOWNGRADE_CHECK_PASS=1

          After that, you can upload Asuswrt-Merlin through
          the webui like any regular firmware upgrade.

          This is only required when flashing Asuswrt-Merlin
          for the first time.

  - NOTE: The new GPL codebase changed the way wireless networks
          are configured.  If you ever revert to an older
          firmware, you MUST do a factory default reset following
          the firmware downgrade, on both the router and any
          existing AiMesh nodes.

  - NEW: (re-added) VPN interface selector on the Speedtest page,
         to test a VPN tunnel's throughput.
  - UPDATED: Merged with GPL 3006.102_37346 (with the wifi firmware
             from 37038 for the RT-BE96U and GT-BE98_PRO - was missing
             from GPL)
  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2024.86.
  - CHANGED: VPN public IP retrieval now uses HTTP instead of STUN,
             which should be more reliable through a VPN tunnel.
  - CHANGED: Model name will be inserted in the filename of JFFS backups.
  - CHANGED: Display DHCP leases from other VLANs
  - CHANGED: Improved refresh behaviour of the VPN Status page.
  - CHANGED: Set rp_filter mode to "loose" on Wireguard client interfaces.
             Fixes gettunnelip.sh and onboard speedtest.
  - FIXED: webui always redirecting to router hostname for RT-BE86U.
  - FIXED: DLNA device icon missing for GT-BE98_PRO
  - FIXED: Site Survey page not loading properly
  - FIXED: Wireless Log would sometimes display the wrong hostnames
  - FIXED: Refresh link not working on OpenVPN/Wireguard client pages.
  - FIXED: WireGuard client randomly failing to retrieve public IP
           for display on the webui.
  - FIXED: Some Guest Networks wouldn't properly list their
           connected clients on the Wireless Log page.


3006.102.2_2 (17-Nov-2024)
  - FIXED: Security issues in AiCloud (backports from Asus)


3006.102.2 (3-Nov-2024)
  - NEW: Added support for RT-BE88U (based on GPL 3.0.0.6.102_33921)
  - NEW: Added support for RT-BE86U (based on GPL 3.0.0.6.102_36216)
  - NEW: Added mDNS support to the router's local name resolution
         (nss).
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.12.
  - CHANGED: Support importing Wireguard config files that
             contain multiple AllowedIPs, Address or DNS
             declarations.
  - CHANGED: Re-added firmware version display on Sysinfo page
             (as you can't copy the version string from the
             header banner, this one can be).
  - CHANGED: VPN killswitch will now only be active if the
             VPN client itself is enabled.  If you stop/start
             the client yourself over SSH, you need to also
             update the enabled/disabled nvram setting.
  - CHANGED: Display public IP address for Wireguard clients.
  - FIXED: Generated web certificate wasn't using the FQDN
           for Namecheap DDNS users.
  - FIXED: DNSDirector and Tor pages would fail to properly load
           in some environment.
  - FIXED: CVE-2024-2511, CVE-2024-4741, CVE-2024-5535 &
           Implicit rejection for RSA PKCS#1 in openssl
           (backport from Ubuntu by RSDNTWK)
  - FIXED: UPnP options were missing on WAN page for models
           with multiservice WAN support.
  - FIXED: Guest Network table would still be shown on the
           DNSDIrector page if DNSDirector isn't enabled.
  - FIXED: VPN Fusion-related popup showing when editing
           an existing DHCP reservation - removed.
  - FIXED: 320 MHz chanspec would show as 160 on the Wifi
           icon status.
  - FIXED: Wifi icon status not properly shown on quad-band
           Wifi 7 models.
  - FIXED: DNS over TLS broken if IoT Guest Network (or other
           Guest Network sharing existing VLAN) is disabled.
           (patch from Asus)


3006.102.1 (28-Jun-2024)

  This is the initial release of Asuswrt-Merlin based on
  the 3006 codebase.  Only a few specific models are
  currently available, more will be added over time as
  Asus progressively migrates devices to the new codebase.

  3006 introduces a number of major features, these will not
  be listed - please review Asus' own documentation on the
  new features added in 3006 (AKA Asuswrt 5.0).  The two most
  notable ones are VLAN and Guest Network Pro (also called
  Self-Defined Networks, or SDN), both of which are supported
  in Asuswrt-Merlin.

  This initial 3006.102.xx release also includes a number of
  potentially breaking changes over 3004.  The most relevant
  ones will be listed below.

  Note that while Asus uses VPNFusion, Asuswrt-Merlin still
  uses VPNDirector.  The integration with Guest Network Pro
  had to be re-implemented to work with Asuswrt-Merlin,
  which required a few backend changes.

  Due to the VPN backend differences, it's strongly recommended
  to do a factory default reset after coming from the original
  Asus firmware if you used any VPN-related functionality.


  - NEW: Added support for GT-BE98_PRO.
  - NEW: Added support for RT-BE96U.
  - NOTE: Wifi 7 devices don't support NFS (issue with new
          toolchain), QoS classification page (issue with
          TrendMicro BWDPI) or Wifi Radar (not updated by
          Broadcom).
  - NEW: Added dnsmasq-INDEX.conf.add and stubby-INDEX.yml.add,
         which are appended to SDN config files (INDEX = SDN
         index number)
  - NEW: Added dnsmasq-sdn.postconf and stubby-sdn.postconf.
         They take two arguments:
           - path to the config file for that SDN's instance
           - the SDN index number (1 for the first SDN instance)

  - NEW: Rewrote VPN killswitch implementation.  The new method
         uses an always present routing rule to prohibit access to
         the main routing table, so it will be active even if the
         user manually stops a client.  Removing the prohibit rule
         requires disabling the killswitch on the webui.
         The rules are also created before WAN goes up, to reduce
         the risks of leaks between WAN going up and VPN connecting.
  - NEW: Added killswitch support for WireGuard clients.
  - UPDATED: Merged with GPL 3.0.0.6.102_34369.
  - UPDATED: Chart.js was upgraded from 2.x to 3.9, to share the
             same version used by Asus.  Any third party addon
             that used it will need to upgrade their charts to
             the new version.
  - UPDATED: wget to 1.24.5.
  - CHANGED: Switched to a different qrcode generation script, to
             share the same script used by Asus.
  - CHANGED: WireGuard and OpenVPN clients use different iproute2
             table IDs, to be in line with Asus's own table IDs.
             The names defined in rt_tables remain unchanged.
  - CHANGED: Implemented support for Wifi 7 and SDN on the
             Wireless Log page.
  - CHANGED: Implemented DNSDirector webui for SDN.
  - CHANGED: Removed stop/start and "Start with WAN" buttons from
             OpenVPN clients.  There is now just a single
             "Enable" option, which will immediately start the
             client when applying changes, and will also start it
             automatically when WAN comes up.  This is to reduce
             confusion, better integrate into SDN, and match how
             WireGuard clients already worked.
  - CHANGED: ipset is now compiled into the kernel rather than as
             modules (to match with Asus)
  - CHANGED: Removed led_disable nvram, we now share the same AllLED
             nvram as used by Asus for the LED button (and AiMesh sync)
  - FIXED: JS error on Wifi 6e/7 models when toggling DDNS.
  - REMOVED: Option dns_local_cache from Tools -> Tweak settings,
             to avoid issues with SDN that run their own
             dnsmasq instances.
  - REMOVED: Wifi Radar was removed (unsupported by Wifi 7 devices,
             and security issues cited by Asus in their own recent
             releases).
