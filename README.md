Asuswrt-Merlin is an enhanced version of Asuswrt, the firmware used by Asus's modern routers.

The goal of this project is to fix issues and bring some minor functionality adjustments to the 
original Asus firmware.  While some features do get added, this is not the main focus of this project.  
It is not meant to replace existing projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT, but rather to offer an alternative 
for people who prefer the original firmware featureset.

This is the new development branch, originally based on Asus's 
3.0.0.4.382_xxxx firmware release.  Not all models are supported yet by this new version, 
please refer to the original 380.xx release for previous model support.  For the time 
being, both the legacy 380.xx and new gen 382.xx/384.xx versions will be developped 
in parallel, until most models have been migrated to the new code base.


Please consult the Wiki for an up-to-date list of supported models:
