README.win32

  Read the README file first.

  Curl has been compiled, built and run on all sorts of Windows and win32
  systems. While not being the main develop target, a fair share of curl users
  are win32-based.

  The unix-style man pages are tricky to read on windows, so therefore are all
  those pages converted to HTML as well as pdf, and included in the release
  archives.

  The main curl.1 man page is also "built-in" in the command line tool. Use a
  command line similar to this in order to extract a separate text file:

        curl -M >manual.txt

  Read the INSTALL file for instructions how to compile curl self.
