curl release procedure - how to do a release
============================================

[in the source code repo]

- edit RELEASE-NOTES to be accurate

- update docs/THANKS

- make sure all relevant changes are committed on the master branch

- tag the git repo in this style: 'git tag -a curl-7_34_0'. -a annotates the
  tag and we use underscores instead of dots in the version number. 
   
- run "./maketgz 7.34.0" to build the release tarballs. It is important that
  you run this on a machine with the correct set of autotools etc installed
  as this is what then will be shipped and used by most users on *nix like
  systems.

- push the git commits and the new tag

- gpg sign the 4 tarballs as maketgz suggests

- upload the 8 resulting files to the primary download directory

[data in the curl-www repo]

- edit Makefile (version number and date),
  _newslog.html (announce the new release) and
  _changes.html (insert changes+bugfixes from RELEASE-NOTES)

- commit all local changes

- tag the repo with the same tag as used for the source repo

- make sure all relevant changes are committed and pushed on the master branch

  (the web site then updates its contents automatically)

[inform]

- send an email to curl-users, curl-announce and curl-library. Insert the
  RELEASE-NOTES into the mail.

[celebrate]

- suitable beverage intake is encouraged for the festivities
