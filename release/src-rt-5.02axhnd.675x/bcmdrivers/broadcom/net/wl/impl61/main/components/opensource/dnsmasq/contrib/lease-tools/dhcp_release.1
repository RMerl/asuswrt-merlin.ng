.TH DHCP_RELEASE 1
.SH NAME
dhcp_release \- Release a DHCP lease on a the local dnsmasq DHCP server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhcp_release <interface> <address> <MAC address> <client_id>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A utility which forces the DHCP server running on this machine to release a 
DHCP lease.
.PP
Send a DHCPRELEASE message via the specified interface to tell the
local DHCP server to delete a particular lease. 

The interface argument is the interface in which a DHCP
request _would_ be received if it was coming from the client, 
rather than being faked up here.
   
The address argument is a dotted-quad IP addresses and mandatory. 
   
The MAC address is colon separated hex, and is mandatory. It may be 
prefixed by an address-type byte followed by -, eg

10-11:22:33:44:55:66

but if the address-type byte is missing it is assumed to be 1, the type 
for ethernet. This encoding is the one used in dnsmasq lease files.

The client-id is optional. If it is "*" then it treated as being missing.
.SH NOTES
MUST be run as root - will fail otherwise.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Only usable on IPv4 DHCP leases.
