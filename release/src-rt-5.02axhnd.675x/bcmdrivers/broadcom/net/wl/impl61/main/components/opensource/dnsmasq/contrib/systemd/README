Hello,

I created a systemd service file for dnsmasq.
systemd is a sysvinit replacement (see [1] for more information).
One of the goals of systemd is to encourage standardization between different
distributions. This means, while I also submitted a ticket in Debian GNU/Linux,
I would like to ask you to accept this service file as the upstream
distributor, so that other distributions can use the same service file and
donâ€™t have to ship their own.

Please include this file in your next release (just like in init script).
