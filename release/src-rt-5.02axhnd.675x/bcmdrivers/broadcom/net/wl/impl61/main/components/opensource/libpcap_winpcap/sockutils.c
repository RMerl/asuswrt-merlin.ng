	The goal of this file is to provide a common set of primitives for socket manipulation.
	Although the socket interface defined in the RFC 2553 (and its updates) is excellent, several
	minor issues are still hidden in supporting several operating systems.

	These calls do not want to provide a better socket interface; vice versa, they intend to
	provide a set of calls that is portable among several operating systems, hiding their
	differences.

	only the buffer overflow check has to be made.
	In this case, both 'buffer' and 'tempbuf' can be NULL values.

	This function is useful in case the userland application does not know immediately
	all the data it has to write into the socket. This function provides a way to create

	\brief It retrieves two strings containing the address and the port of a given 'sockaddr' variable.

	This function is basically an extended version of the inet_ntop(), which does not exist in
	WIN32 because the same result can be obtained by using the getnameinfo().
	However, differently from inet_ntop(), this function is able to return also literal names
	(e.g. 'locahost') dependingly from the 'Flags' parameter.

	The function accepts a sockaddr_storage variable (which can be returned by several functions
	like bind(), connect(), accept(), and more) and it transforms its content into a 'human'
	form. So, for instance, it is able to translate an hex address (stored in bynary form) into
	a standard IPv6 address like "::1".

	The behaviour of this function depends on the parameters we have in the 'Flags' variable, which
	are the ones allowed in the standard getnameinfo() socket function.

	\param sockaddr: a 'sockaddr_in' or 'sockaddr_in6' structure containing the address that
	need to be translated from network form into the presentation form. This structure must be
	zero-ed prior using it, and the address family field must be filled with the proper value.
	The user must cast any 'sockaddr_in' or 'sockaddr_in6' structures to 'sockaddr_storage' before
	calling this function.

	\param address: it contains the address that will be returned by the function. This buffer
	must be properly allocated by the user. The address can be either literal or numeric depending
	on the value of 'Flags'.

	\param addrlen: the length of the 'address' buffer.

	\param port: it contains the port that will be returned by the function. This buffer
	must be properly allocated by the user.

	\param portlen: the length of the 'port' buffer.

	\param flags: a set of flags (the ones defined into the getnameinfo() standard socket function)
	that determine if the resulting address must be in numeric / literal form, and so on.

	\param errbuf: a pointer to an user-allocated buffer that will contain the complete
	error message. This buffer has to be at least 'errbuflen' in length.
