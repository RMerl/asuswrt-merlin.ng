/**
 * hash - fast hash of an array for internal use
 * @p: the array or pointer to first element
 * @num: the number of elements to hash
 * @base: the base number to roll into the hash (usually 0)
 *
 * The memory region pointed to by p is combined with the base to form
 * a 32-bit hash.
 *
 * This hash will have different results on different machines, so is
 * only useful for internal hashes (ie. not hashes sent across the
 * network or saved to disk).
 *
 * It may also change with future versions: it could even detect at runtime
 * what the fastest hash to use is.
 *
 * See also: hash64, hash_stable.
 *
 * Example:
 *	#include <ccan/hash/hash.h>
 *	#include <err.h>
 *	#include <stdio.h>
 *	#include <string.h>
 *
 *	// Simple demonstration: idential strings will have the same hash, but
 *	// two different strings will probably not.
 *	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 *	{
 *		uint32_t hash1, hash2;
 *
 *		if (argc != 3)
 *			err(1, "Usage: %s <string1> <string2>", argv[0]);
 *
 *		hash1 = __nl_hash(argv[1], strlen(argv[1]), 0);
 *		hash2 = __nl_hash(argv[2], strlen(argv[2]), 0);
 *		printf("Hash is %s\n", hash1 == hash2 ? "same" : "different");
 *		return 0;
 *	}
