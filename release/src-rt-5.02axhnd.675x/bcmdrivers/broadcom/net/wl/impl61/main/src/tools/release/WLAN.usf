#
# This is a common config file which is used mainly by modules
# or brand makefiles. The ".usf" suffix stands for "universal
# settings file". The important feature is that this file is
# both legal makefile and shell syntax, and could also be parsed
# as a properties file by any language (Perl, Python, Java, ...)
# which understands properties.
#
# Rules: Each line is either an assignment, a comment, or blank.
# Assignments MUST be of the form "foo=bar" (no spaces around
# the =) and comments have a leading "#" character. Continuation
# lines are allowed only within quotes.
#
# It's available to be included by makefiles like WLAN_Common.mk,
# or by brand makefiles, or sourced by build scripts.
