    *  BOARD_EARLYINIT()
    *
    *  Initialize board registers.  This is the earliest
    *  time the BSP gets control.  This routine cannot assume that
    *  memory is operational, and therefore all code in this routine
    *  must run from registers only.  The lr register must not
    *  be modified, as it contains the return address.
    *
    *  This routine will be called from uncached space, before
    *  the caches are initialized
    *
    *  Among other things, this is where the GPIO registers get
    *  programmed to make on-board LEDs function, or other startup
    *  that has to be done before anything will work.
    *
    *  Input parameters:
    *       nothing
    *       x0, x1, x2 used
    *
    *  Return value:
