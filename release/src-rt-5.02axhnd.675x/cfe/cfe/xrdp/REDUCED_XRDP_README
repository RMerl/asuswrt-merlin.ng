REDUCED XRDP CFE README

1) REDUCED_XRDP CFE mode is indicated by a new define _CFE_REDUCED_XRDP_ that should be set
   - in project's make.proj_flags
   - in cfe/build/broadcom/bcm63xx_ram/Makefile for the relevant BRCM_CHIP.
   This new define is temporary, to enable gradual migration of XRDP devices to the "reduced XRDP" mode.
   Once all XRDP defices will have migrated, _CFE_REDUCED_XRDP_ define can be
   removed and all references to it in the source code replaced with _CFE_

2) REDUCED_XRDP support is implemented as a new project XRDP_CFE on rdp level.
   When a new device is migrated to the REDUCED_XRDP mode, RDP_PROJECT variable in
   cfe/build/broadcom/bcm63xx_ram/Makefile should be set "RDP_PROJECT=XRDP_CFE".
   See 6858 case for reference.

3) cfe/cfe/xrdp/Makefile should refer to the relevant sources list. See PROJ_DRV_SRC_LIST
   assignment in the beginning of the Makefile.
   Additional per-chip source lists can be added under XRDP_CFE project.
   Hopefully, all XRDP-based devices can use the same FW and sources.
   The difference, if any, will be confined to memory map.

4) compiling specific CHIP CFE FW
   make PROJECT=XRDP_CFE BRCM_CHIP=6858 clean fw

Build modes:

1) Default mode. Neither CONFIG_GPL_RDP=1 nor CONFIG_GPL_RDP_GEN=1 is set.
   Example: cd cfe/build/broadcom/bcm63xx_rom; make BRCM_CHIP=6858
   In this mode all initializations are done by XRDP drivers (non GPL)


2) Access logging mode. This mode is functionally similar to the default mode above.
   All register and SRAM accesses are logged on the console. After that, saved console log
   is converted to initialization .h file using cfe/cfe/xrdp/gen_data_path_init_data.sh.
   Usage:
    1) cd cfe/build/broadcom/bcm63xx_rom;
    2) edit Makefile, add 'CONFIG_GPL_RDP=0 CONFIG_GPL_RDP_GEN=1' to CFE ROM and CFE RAM targets, i.e change:
             $(MAKE) BRCM_CHIP=6858
       to:
             $(MAKE) BRCM_CHIP=6858 CONFIG_GPL_RDP=0 CONFIG_GPL_RDP_GEN=1
       and change:
	         $(MAKE) BRCM_CHIP=6858 BLD_NAND=1
       to
	         $(MAKE) BRCM_CHIP=6858 BLD_NAND=1 CONFIG_GPL_RDP=0 CONFIG_GPL_RDP_GEN=1 

       Then run 'make release'.
       This build will also automatically generates files
             $(PROJECT_DIR)/drivers/rdd/rdd_data_structures_auto_gpl_6858.h
       and
             $(PROJECT_DIR)/drivers/rdd/rdd_data_structures_auto_gpl_6858.c
       Then rebuild and reburn CE image.
    2) Clear console. Load CFE and press "enter" during CFE boot
    3) Save console log into file (e.g., /tmp/session.log)
    4) Generate data_path_init_basic_data.h file
       cfe/cfe/xrdp/gen_data_path_init_data.sh /tmp/session.log rdp/projects/XRDP_CFE/drivers/rdp_subsystem/BCM6858/data_path_init_basic_data.h

3) GPL mode. In this mode only bare minimum of XRDP source files are included in the build.
   All initializations are done using data_path_init_basic_data.h generated in "access logging mode".
   Usage:
    1) Revert changes in Makefile dor for access logging mode.
    2) Run 'make release' (by default, will set CONFIG_GPL_RDP=1 for 6858)

   The XRDP files needed in GPL mode can be found in cfe/cfe/xrdp
