  <description source="TRx">Ethernet statistics based on the {{bibref|RFC2819}} ''RMON-MIB'' ''etherStatsTable'', with some extensions inspired by {{bibref|G.988|Section 9.3.32}}. Each instance is associated with an interface capable of transporting Ethernet-encapsulated packets, and contains a set of unidirectional Ethernet statistics. The statistics are sampled either on ingress or on egress. This is determined as follows: * If the instance is associated with an egress queue (or queues) via the {{param|Queue}} parameter or by setting {{param|AllQueues}} to {{true}} then data is sampled on egress. In this case {{param|Bytes}} etc measure the data that has been sent on the interface, possibly filtered by {{param|Queue}} or {{param|VLANID}}. * Otherwise data is sampled on ingress. In this case {{param|Bytes}} etc measure the data that has been received on the interface, possibly filtered by {{param|VLANID}}. When sampling on egress, the term ''received'' means ''received by the queuing sub-system''. Multiple instances can be associated with a single interface: individual instances can be configured to collect data associated with the entire interface, or with a particular VLAN and/or queue. The CPE MUST reset each instances's Stats parameters whenever the instance is disabled and re-enabled. Whether this reset occurs when the instance becomes operationally disabled ({{param|Status}} = {{enum|Disabled|Status}}) or administratively enabled ({{param|Enable}} = {{true}}) is a local matter to the CPE. This is similar to the behavior of interface statistics, e.g. as specified for {{object|Device.Ethernet.Interface.{i}.Stats}}. Furthermore, this instance's Stats parameters MUST be reset whenever the referenced interface's Stats parameters are reset, or when the referenced queue or VLAN is disabled and re-enabled. For enabled table entries, if {{param|Interface}} references an interface that is not capable of transporting Ethernet-encapsulated packets, or if {{param|Queue}} references a queue that is not instantiated on {{param|Interface}}, or if {{param|Queue}} is not a valid reference and {{param|AllQueues}} is {{false}}, the table entry is inoperable and the CPE MUST set {{param|Status}} to {{enum|Error_Misconfigured|Status}}. Note: The {{object}} table includes unique key parameters that are strong references. If a strongly referenced object is deleted, the CPE will set the referencing parameter to {{empty}}. However, doing so under these circumstances might cause the updated {{object}} row to then violate the table's unique key constraint; if this occurs, the CPE MUST set {{param|Status}} to {{enum|Error_Misconfigured|Status}} and disable the offending {{object}} row. </description>
