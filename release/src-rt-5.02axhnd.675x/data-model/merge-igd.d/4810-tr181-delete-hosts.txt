# Delete the TR181 Hosts object from the tree.  We only do this in
# the merge-igd.d directory for the hybrid TR98+181 data model.  In the
# hybrid data model, we use the Hosts object from the TR98 spec,
# not the TR181 spec.
#
# Note that if the deleted object has children, the children will also be deleted.
#
# See 0000-README.txt for more details
