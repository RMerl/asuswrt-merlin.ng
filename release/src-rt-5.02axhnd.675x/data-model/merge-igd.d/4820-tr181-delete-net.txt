# Delete unneeded TR181 networking objects from the tree.  We only do this in
# the merge-igd.d directory for the hybrid TR98+181 data model.  In the
# hybrid data model, we mostly use network objects from the TR98 spec,
# not the TR181 spec.
#
# Note that if the deleted object has children, the children will also be deleted.
#
# See 0000-README.txt for more details

#deleteParam InternetGatewayDevice.Device.Routing.Router.{i}.IPv4ForwardingNumberOfEntries
#deleteObj InternetGatewayDevice.Device.Routing.Router.{i}.IPv4Forwarding.{i}.
# It is tempting to delete IPv4Forwarding.{i}. and IPv4ForwardingNumberOfEntries
# from the data model.  But deleting IPv4ForwardingNumberOfEntries param
# causes problems for the DM detect mode because the Router.{i}. object
# needs to be the same size in both Hybrid and Pure181, so if we delete
# a param in Hybrid mode, we also have to delete that param in the
# Pure181 mode.  So it is better to just keep these IPv4 related
# objects and params in the Hybrid mode, even though we will not use them.
