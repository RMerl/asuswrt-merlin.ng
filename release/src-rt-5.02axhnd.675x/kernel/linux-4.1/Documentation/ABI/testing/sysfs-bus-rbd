What:		/sys/bus/rbd/
Date:		November 2010
Contact:	Yehuda Sadeh <yehuda@newdream.net>,

Description:

Being used for adding and removing rbd block devices.

Usage: <mon ip addr> <options> <pool name> <rbd image name> [snap name]

 $ echo "192.168.0.1 name=admin rbd foo" > /sys/bus/rbd/add

The snapshot name can be "-" or omitted to map the image read/write. A <dev-id>
will be assigned for any registered block device. If snapshot is used, it will
be mapped read-only.

Removal of a device:

  $ echo <dev-id> > /sys/bus/rbd/remove

What:		/sys/bus/rbd/add_single_major
Date:		December 2013
KernelVersion:	3.14
Contact:	Sage Weil <sage@inktank.com>
Description:	Available only if rbd module is inserted with single_major
		parameter set to true.
		Usage is the same as for /sys/bus/rbd/add.  If present,
		should be used instead of the latter: any attempts to use
		/sys/bus/rbd/add if /sys/bus/rbd/add_single_major is
		available will fail for backwards compatibility reasons.
