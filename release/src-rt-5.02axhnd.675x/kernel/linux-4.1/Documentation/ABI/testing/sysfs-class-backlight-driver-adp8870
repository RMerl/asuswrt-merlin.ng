Description:
		Control the dim brightness for <ambient light zone>
		on this <backlight>. Values are between 0 and 127, typically
		set to 0. Full off when the backlight is disabled.
		This file will also show the dim brightness level stored for

Description:
		Get conversion value of the light sensor.
		This value is updated every 80 ms (when the light sensor
		is enabled). Returns integer between 0 (dark) and
		8000 (max ambient brightness)

What:		/sys/class/backlight/<backlight>/ambient_light_zone
Date:		May 2011
KernelVersion:	3.0
Contact:	device-drivers-devel@blackfin.uclinux.org
Description:
		Get/Set current ambient light zone. Reading returns
		integer between 1..5 (1 = daylight, 2 = bright, ..., 5 = dark).
		Writing a value between 1..5 forces the backlight controller
		to enter the corresponding ambient light zone.
		Writing 0 returns to normal/automatic ambient light level
		operation. The ambient light sensing feature on these devices
		is an extension to the API documented in
		Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-class-backlight.
		It can be enabled by writing the value stored in
		/sys/class/backlight/<backlight>/max_brightness to
		/sys/class/backlight/<backlight>/brightness.
