Date:		May 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	Daniel Mack <daniel@caiaq.de>
Description:
		This file is writeable and can be used to set the current
		coloumb counter value inside the battery monitor chip. This
		is needed for unavoidable corrections of aging batteries.
		A userspace daemon can monitor the battery charging logic
		and once the counter drops out of considerable bounds, take
		appropriate action.

KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	Daniel Mack <daniel@caiaq.de>
Description:
		This file is writeable and can be used to set the assumed
		battery 'full level'. As batteries age, this value has to be
		amended over time.

Date:		October 2014
KernelVersion:	3.18.0
Contact:	Krzysztof Kozlowski <k.kozlowski@samsung.com>
Description:
		This entry shows and sets the maximum time the max14577
		charger operates in fast-charge mode. When the timer expires
		the device will terminate fast-charge mode (charging current
		will drop to 0 A) and will trigger interrupt.

		Valid values:
		- 5, 6 or 7 (hours),
		- 0: disabled.

Description:
		This entry shows and sets the maximum time the max77693
		charger operates in fast-charge mode. When the timer expires
		the device will terminate fast-charge mode (charging current
		will drop to 0 A) and will trigger interrupt.

		Valid values:
		- 4 - 16 (hours), step by 2 (rounded down)
		- 0: disabled.

Date:		January 2015
KernelVersion:	3.19.0
Contact:	Krzysztof Kozlowski <k.kozlowski@samsung.com>
Description:
		This entry shows and sets the charging current threshold for
		entering top-off charging mode. When charging current in fast
		charge mode drops below this value, the charger will trigger
		interrupt and start top-off charging mode.

		Valid values:
		- 100000 - 200000 (microamps), step by 25000 (rounded down)
		- 200000 - 350000 (microamps), step by 50000 (rounded down)
		- 0: disabled.
