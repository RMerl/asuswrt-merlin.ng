Description:
		This file contains the enumerated host ID for the Intel
		SCU controller. The Intel(R) C600 Series Chipset SATA/SAS
		Storage Control Unit embeds up to two 4-port controllers in
		a single PCI device.  The controllers are enumerated in order
		which usually means the lowest number scsi_host corresponds
		with the first controller, but this association is not
		guaranteed.  The 'isci_id' attribute unambiguously identifies
		the controller index: '0' for the first controller,
		'1' for the second.

Description:	This file contains the current status of the "SSD Smart Path"
		feature of HP Smart Array RAID controllers using the hpsa
		driver.  SSD Smart Path, when enabled permits the driver to
		send i/o requests directly to physical devices that are part
		of a logical drive, bypassing the controllers firmware RAID
		stack for a performance advantage when possible.  A value of
		'1' indicates the feature is enabled, and the controller may
		use the direct i/o path to physical devices.  A value of zero
		means the feature is disabled and the controller may not use
		the direct i/o path to physical devices.  This setting is
		controller wide, affecting all configured logical drives on the
		controller.  This file is readable and writable.
