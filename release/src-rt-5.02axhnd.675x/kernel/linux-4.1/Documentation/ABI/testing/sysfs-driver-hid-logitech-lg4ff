		  Tag: Mode Name
		Currently active mode is marked with an asterisk. List also
		contains an abstract item "native" which always denotes the
		native mode of the wheel. Echoing the mode tag switches the
		wheel into the corresponding mode. Depending on the exact model
		of the wheel not all listed modes might always be selectable.
		If a wheel cannot be switched into the desired mode, -EINVAL
		is returned accompanied with an explanatory message in the
		kernel log.
		This entry is not created for devices that have only one mode.

		Currently supported mode switches:
		Driving Force Pro:
		  DF-EX --> DFP

		G25:
		  DF-EX --> DFP --> G25

		G27:
		  DF-EX <*> DFP <-> G25 <-> G27

		  DF-EX <*----------------> G27

		DFGT:
		  DF-EX <*> DFP <-> DFGT
		  DF-EX <*--------> DFGT
