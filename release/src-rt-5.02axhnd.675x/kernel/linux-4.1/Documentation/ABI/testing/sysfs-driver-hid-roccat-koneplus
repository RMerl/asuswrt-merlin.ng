Description:	The integer value of this attribute ranges from 0-4.
                When read, this attribute returns the number of the actual
                profile. This value is persistent, so its equivalent to the
                profile that's active when the mouse is powered on next time.
		When written, this file sets the number of the startup profile
		and the mouse activates this profile immediately.

Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
		press of a button. A profile is split in settings and buttons.
		profile_buttons holds information about button layout.
		When written, this file lets one write the respective profile
		buttons back to the mouse. The data has to be 77 bytes long.
		The mouse will reject invalid data.
		Which profile to write is determined by the profile number
		contained in the data.
		Before reading this file, control has to be written to select
		which profile to read.
