Description:	read-only access to the SID (Security-ID) on current
		A-series SoC's from Allwinner. Currently supports A10, A10s, A13
		and A20 CPU's. The earlier A1x series of SoCs exports 16 bytes,
		whereas the newer A20 SoC exposes 512 bytes split into sections.
		Besides the 16 bytes of SID, there's also an SJTAG area,
		HDMI-HDCP key and some custom keys. Below a quick overview, for
		details see the user manual:
		0x000  128 bit root-key (sun[457]i)
		0x010  128 bit boot-key (sun7i)
		0x020   64 bit security-jtag-key (sun7i)
		0x028   16 bit key configuration (sun7i)
		0x02b   16 bit custom-vendor-key (sun7i)
		0x02c  320 bit low general key (sun7i)
		0x040   32 bit read-control access (sun7i)
		0x064  224 bit low general key (sun7i)
		0x080 2304 bit HDCP-key (sun7i)
		0x1a0  768 bit high general key (sun7i)
Users:		any user space application which wants to read the SID on
		Allwinner's A-series of CPU's.
