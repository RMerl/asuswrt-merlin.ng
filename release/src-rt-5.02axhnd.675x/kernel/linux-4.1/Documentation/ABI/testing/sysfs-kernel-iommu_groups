Description:	/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/ contains a number of sub-
		directories, each representing an IOMMU group.  The
		name of the sub-directory matches the iommu_group_id()
		for the group, which is an integer value.  Within each
		subdirectory is another directory named "devices" with
		links to the sysfs devices contained in this group.
		The group directory also optionally contains a "name"
		file if the IOMMU driver has chosen to register a more
		common name for the group.
