i.MX6 Quad SABRE Automotive Board
Required root node properties:
    - compatible = "fsl,imx6q-sabreauto", "fsl,imx6q";

Generic i.MX boards
-------------------

No iomux setup is done for these boards, so this must have been configured
by the bootloader for boards to work with the generic bindings.

i.MX27 generic board
Required root node properties:
    - compatible = "fsl,imx27";

i.MX51 generic board
Required root node properties:
    - compatible = "fsl,imx51";

i.MX53 generic board
Required root node properties:
    - compatible = "fsl,imx53";

i.MX6q generic board
Required root node properties:
    - compatible = "fsl,imx6q";

Freescale Vybrid Platform Device Tree Bindings
----------------------------------------------

For the Vybrid SoC familiy all variants with DDR controller are supported,
which is the VF5xx and VF6xx series. Out of historical reasons, in most
places the kernel uses vf610 to refer to the whole familiy.

Required root node compatible property (one of them):
    - compatible = "fsl,vf500";
    - compatible = "fsl,vf510";
    - compatible = "fsl,vf600";
    - compatible = "fsl,vf610";

Freescale LS1021A Platform Device Tree Bindings
------------------------------------------------

Required root node compatible properties:
  - compatible = "fsl,ls1021a";

Freescale LS1021A SoC-specific Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------

Freescale SCFG
  SCFG is the supplemental configuration unit, that provides SoC specific
configuration and status registers for the chip. Such as getting PEX port
status.
  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "fsl,ls1021a-scfg"
  - reg: should contain base address and length of SCFG memory-mapped registers

Example:
	scfg: scfg@1570000 {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-scfg";
		reg = <0x0 0x1570000 0x0 0x10000>;
	};

Freescale DCFG
  DCFG is the device configuration unit, that provides general purpose
configuration and status for the device. Such as setting the secondary
core start address and release the secondary core from holdoff and startup.
  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "fsl,ls1021a-dcfg"
  - reg : should contain base address and length of DCFG memory-mapped registers

Example:
	dcfg: dcfg@1ee0000 {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-dcfg";
		reg = <0x0 0x1ee0000 0x0 0x10000>;
	};
