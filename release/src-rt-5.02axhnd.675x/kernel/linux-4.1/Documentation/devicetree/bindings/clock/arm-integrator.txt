Clock bindings for ARM Integrator and Versatile Core Module clocks

Auxiliary Oscillator Clock

This is a configurable clock fed from a 24 MHz chrystal,
used for generating e.g. video clocks. It is located on the
core module and there is only one of these.

This clock node *must* be a subnode of the core module, since
it obtains the base address for it's address range from its
parent node.


Required properties:
- compatible: must be "arm,integrator-cm-auxosc" or "arm,versatile-cm-auxosc"
- #clock-cells: must be <0>

Optional properties:
- clocks: parent clock(s)

Example:

core-module@10000000 {
	xtal24mhz: xtal24mhz@24M {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		clock-frequency = <24000000>;
	};
	auxosc: cm_aux_osc@25M {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "arm,integrator-cm-auxosc";
		clocks = <&xtal24mhz>;
	};
};
