Broadcom Cygnus Clocks

This binding uses the common clock binding:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Currently various "fixed" clocks are declared for peripheral drivers that use
the common clock framework to reference their core clocks. Proper support of
these clocks will be added later

Device tree example:

	clocks {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		osc: oscillator {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clock-frequency = <25000000>;
		};

		apb_clk: apb_clk {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <1000000000>;
		};

		periph_clk: periph_clk {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <500000000>;
		};
	};
