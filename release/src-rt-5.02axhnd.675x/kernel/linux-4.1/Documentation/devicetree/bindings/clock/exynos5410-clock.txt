* Samsung Exynos5410 Clock Controller

The Exynos5410 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Exynos5410 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "samsung,exynos5410-clock"

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exynos5410.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

External clock:

There is clock that is generated outside the SoC. It
is expected that it is defined using standard clock bindings
with following clock-output-name:

 - "fin_pll" - PLL input clock from XXTI

Example 1: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.

	clock: clock-controller@0x10010000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5410-clock";
		reg = <0x10010000 0x30000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example 2: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
	   controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
	   about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

	serial@12C20000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-uart";
		reg = <0x12C00000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 51 0>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_UART0>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_UART0>;
		clock-names = "uart", "clk_uart_baud0";
	};
