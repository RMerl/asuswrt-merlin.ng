* Clock bindings for Freescale i.MX21

Required properties:
- compatible  : Should be "fsl,imx21-ccm".
- reg         : Address and length of the register set.
- interrupts  : Should contain CCM interrupt.
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>.

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell. See include/dt-bindings/clock/imx21-clock.h
for the full list of i.MX21 clock IDs.

Examples:
	clks: ccm@10027000{
		compatible = "fsl,imx21-ccm";
		reg = <0x10027000 0x800>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	uart1: serial@1000a000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx21-uart";
		reg = <0x1000a000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <20>;
		clocks = <&clks IMX21_CLK_UART1_IPG_GATE>,
			 <&clks IMX21_CLK_PER1>;
		clock-names = "ipg", "per";
		status = "disabled";
	};
