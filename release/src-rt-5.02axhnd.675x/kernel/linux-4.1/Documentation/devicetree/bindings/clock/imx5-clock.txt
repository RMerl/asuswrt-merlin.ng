* Clock bindings for Freescale i.MX5

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,<soc>-ccm" , where <soc> can be imx51 or imx53
- reg: Address and length of the register set
- interrupts: Should contain CCM interrupt
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell. See include/dt-bindings/clock/imx5-clock.h
for the full list of i.MX5 clock IDs.

Examples (for mx53):

clks: ccm@53fd4000{
	compatible = "fsl,imx53-ccm";
	reg = <0x53fd4000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 71 0x04 0 72 0x04>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

can1: can@53fc8000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx53-flexcan", "fsl,p1010-flexcan";
	reg = <0x53fc8000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <82>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX5_CLK_CAN1_IPG_GATE>, <&clks IMX5_CLK_CAN1_SERIAL_GATE>;
	clock-names = "ipg", "per";
	status = "disabled";
};
