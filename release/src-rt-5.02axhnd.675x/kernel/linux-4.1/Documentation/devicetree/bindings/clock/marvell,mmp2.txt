* Marvell MMP2 Clock Controller

The MMP2 clock subsystem generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the MMP2 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "marvell,mmp2-clock" - controller compatible with MMP2 SoC.

- reg: physical base address of the clock subsystem and length of memory mapped
  region. There are 3 places in SOC has clock control logic:
  "mpmu", "apmu", "apbc". So three reg spaces need to be defined.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.
- #reset-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/marvell-mmp2.h>.
