This binding uses the common clock binding[1].
Base address is located to the parent node. See clock binding[2]

Required properties:

- compatible : shall be:
	"st,clkgena-prediv-c65",	"st,clkgena-prediv"
	"st,clkgena-prediv-c32",	"st,clkgena-prediv"

- #clock-cells : From common clock binding; shall be set to 0.

- clocks : From common clock binding

- clock-output-names : From common clock binding.

Example:

	clockgen-a@fd345000 {
		reg = <0xfd345000 0xb50>;

		clk_m_a2_osc_prediv: clk-m-a2-osc-prediv {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "st,clkgena-prediv-c32",
				     "st,clkgena-prediv";

			clocks = <&clk_sysin>;

			clock-output-names = "clk-m-a2-osc-prediv";
		};
	};
