Overview

DESCRIPTION

SEC 4 h/w can process requests from 2 types of sources.
1. DPAA Queue Interface (HW interface between Queue Manager & SEC 4).
2. Job Rings (HW interface between cores & SEC 4 registers).

High Speed Data Path Configuration:

HW interface between QM & SEC 4 and also BM & SEC 4, on DPAA-enabled parts
such as the P4080.  The number of simultaneous dequeues the QI can make is
equal to the number of Descriptor Controller (DECO) engines in a particular
SEC version.  E.g., the SEC 4.0 in the P4080 has 5 DECOs and can thus
dequeue from 5 subportals simultaneously.

Job Ring Data Path Configuration:

Each JR is located on a separate 4k page, they may (or may not) be made visible
in the memory partition devoted to a particular core.  The P4080 has 4 JRs, so
up to 4 JRs can be configured; and all 4 JRs process requests in parallel.

SEC 4 Node

Description

    Node defines the base address of the SEC 4 block.
    This block specifies the address range of all global
    configuration registers for the SEC 4 block.  It
    also receives interrupts from the Run Time Integrity Check
    (RTIC) function within the SEC 4 block.
