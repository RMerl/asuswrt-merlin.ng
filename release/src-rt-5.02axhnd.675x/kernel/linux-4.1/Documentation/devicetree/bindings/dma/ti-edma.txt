TI EDMA

Required properties:
- compatible : "ti,edma3"
- #dma-cells: Should be set to <1>
              Clients should use a single channel number per DMA request.
- reg: Memory map for accessing module
- interrupt-parent: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
- interrupts: Exactly 3 interrupts need to be specified in the order:
              1. Transfer completion interrupt.
              2. Memory protection interrupt.
              3. Error interrupt.
Optional properties:
- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmods associated to the EDMA
- ti,edma-xbar-event-map: Crossbar event to channel map

Deprecated properties:
Listed here in case one wants to boot an old kernel with new DTB. These
properties might need to be added to the new DTS files.
- ti,edma-regions: Number of regions
- ti,edma-slots: Number of slots
- dma-channels: Specify total DMA channels per CC

Example:

edma: edma@49000000 {
	reg = <0x49000000 0x10000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <12 13 14>;
	compatible = "ti,edma3";
	ti,hwmods = "tpcc", "tptc0", "tptc1", "tptc2";
	#dma-cells = <1>;
	ti,edma-xbar-event-map = /bits/ 16 <1 12
					    2 13>;
};
