Device-Tree bindings for tilcdc DRM driver

Required properties:
 - compatible: value should be "ti,am33xx-tilcdc".
 - interrupts: the interrupt number
 - reg: base address and size of the LCDC device

Recommended properties:
 - interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.
 - ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated to the LCDC

Optional properties:
 - max-bandwidth: The maximum pixels per second that the memory
   interface / lcd controller combination can sustain
 - max-width: The maximum horizontal pixel width supported by
   the lcd controller.
 - max-pixelclock: The maximum pixel clock that can be supported
   by the lcd controller in KHz.

Example:

	fb: fb@4830e000 {
		compatible = "ti,am33xx-tilcdc";
		reg = <0x4830e000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <36>;
		ti,hwmods = "lcdc";
	};
