EEPROMs (I2C)

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "<manufacturer>,<type>"
		 If there is no specific driver for <manufacturer>, a generic
		 driver based on <type> is selected. Possible types are:
		 24c00, 24c01, 24c02, 24c04, 24c08, 24c16, 24c32, 24c64,
		 24c128, 24c256, 24c512, 24c1024, spd

  - reg : the I2C address of the EEPROM

Optional properties:

  - pagesize : the length of the pagesize for writing. Please consult the
               manual of your device, that value varies a lot. A wrong value
	       may result in data loss! If not specified, a safety value of
	       '1' is used which will be very slow.

  - read-only: this parameterless property disables writes to the eeprom

Example:

eeprom@52 {
	compatible = "atmel,24c32";
	reg = <0x52>;
	pagesize = <32>;
};
