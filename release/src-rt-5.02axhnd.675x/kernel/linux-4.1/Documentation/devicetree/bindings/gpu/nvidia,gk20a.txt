NVIDIA GK20A Graphics Processing Unit

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,<chip>-<gpu>"
  Currently recognized values:
  - nvidia,tegra124-gk20a
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
  Must contain two entries:
  - first entry for bar0
  - second entry for bar1
- interrupts: Must contain an entry for each entry in interrupt-names.
  See ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for details.
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
  - stall
  - nonstall
- vdd-supply: regulator for supply voltage.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - gpu
  - pwr
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - gpu

Example:

	gpu@0,57000000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,gk20a";
