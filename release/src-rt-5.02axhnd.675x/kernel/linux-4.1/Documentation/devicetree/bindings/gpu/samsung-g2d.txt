* Samsung 2D Graphics Accelerator

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be one among the following:
	(a) "samsung,s5pv210-g2d" for G2D IP present in S5PV210 & Exynos4210 SoC
	(b) "samsung,exynos4212-g2d" for G2D IP present in Exynos4x12 SoCs
	(c) "samsung,exynos5250-g2d" for G2D IP present in Exynos5250 SoC

  - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.

  - interrupts : G2D interrupt number to the CPU.
  - clocks : from common clock binding: handle to G2D clocks.
  - clock-names : names of clocks listed in clocks property, in the same
		  order, depending on SoC type:
		  - for S5PV210 and Exynos4 based SoCs: "fimg2d" and
		    "sclk_fimg2d"
		  - for Exynos5250 SoC: "fimg2d".

Example:
	g2d@12800000 {
		compatible = "samsung,s5pv210-g2d";
		reg = <0x12800000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 89 0>;
		clocks = <&clock 177>, <&clock 277>;
		clock-names = "sclk_fimg2d", "fimg2d";
		status = "disabled";
	};
