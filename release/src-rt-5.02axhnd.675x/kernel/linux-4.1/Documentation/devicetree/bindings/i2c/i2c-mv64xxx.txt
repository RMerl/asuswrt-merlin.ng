* Marvell MV64XXX I2C controller

Required properties :

 - reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - compatible      : Should be either:
                     - "allwinner,sun4i-a10-i2c"
                     - "allwinner,sun6i-a31-i2c"
                     - "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c"
                     - "marvell,mv78230-i2c"
                     - "marvell,mv78230-a0-i2c"
                       * Note: Only use "marvell,mv78230-a0-i2c" for a
                         very rare, initial version of the SoC which
                         had broken offload support.  Linux
                         auto-detects this and sets it appropriately.
 - interrupts      : The interrupt number

Optional properties :

 - clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not set the
default frequency is 100kHz

 - resets          : phandle to the parent reset controller. Mandatory
                     whenever you're using the "allwinner,sun6i-a31-i2c"
                     compatible.

Examples:

	i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c";
		reg = <0x11000 0x20>;
		interrupts = <29>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};

For the Armada XP:

	i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv78230-i2c", "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c";
		reg = <0x11000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <29>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};
