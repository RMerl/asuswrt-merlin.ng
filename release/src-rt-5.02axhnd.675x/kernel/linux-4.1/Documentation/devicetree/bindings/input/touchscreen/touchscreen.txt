General Touchscreen Properties:

Optional properties for Touchscreens:
 - touchscreen-size-x		: horizontal resolution of touchscreen
				  (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-size-y		: vertical resolution of touchscreen
				  (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-max-pressure	: maximum reported pressure (arbitrary range
				  dependent on the controller)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-x		: horizontal noise value of the absolute input
				  device (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-y		: vertical noise value of the absolute input
				  device (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-pressure	: pressure noise value of the absolute input
				  device (arbitrary range dependent on the
				  controller)
 - touchscreen-inverted-x	: X axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-inverted-y	: Y axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-swapped-x-y	: X and Y axis are swapped (boolean)
				  Swapping is done after inverting the axis
