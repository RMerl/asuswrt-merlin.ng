* Neonode infrared touchscreen controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "neonode,zforce"
- reg: I2C address of the chip
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected
- gpios: gpios the chip is connected to
  first one is the interrupt gpio and second one the reset gpio
- x-size: horizontal resolution of touchscreen
- y-size: vertical resolution of touchscreen

Optional properties:
- vdd-supply: Regulator controlling the controller supply

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* ... */

		zforce_ts@50 {
			compatible = "neonode,zforce";
			reg = <0x50>;
			interrupts = <2 0>;
			vdd-supply = <&reg_zforce_vdd>;

			gpios = <&gpio5 6 0>, /* INT */
				<&gpio5 9 0>; /* RST */

			x-size = <800>;
			y-size = <600>;
		};

		/* ... */
	};
