Required properties:

- compatible : should be "allwinner,sun7i-a20-sc-nmi" or
  "allwinner,sun6i-a31-sc-nmi"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value shall be 2. The first cell is the IRQ number, the

Example:

sc-nmi-intc@01c00030 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun7i-a20-sc-nmi";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0x01c00030 0x0c>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 0 4>;
};
