Required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,l2-intc"
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. Should be 1.
- interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller
  this controller is cacaded from

  wakeup source for system suspend/resume.

Example:

hif_intr2_intc: interrupt-controller@f0441000 {
	compatible = "brcm,l2-intc";
	reg = <0xf0441000 0x30>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x20 0x0>;
};
