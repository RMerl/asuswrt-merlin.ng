Common leds properties.

LED and flash LED devices provide the same basic functionality as current
regulators, but extended with LED and flash LED specific features like
blinking patterns, flash timeout, flash faults and external flash strobe mode.

Many LED devices expose more than one current output that can be connected
to one or more discrete LED component. Since the arrangement of connections
can influence the way of the LED device initialization, the LED components
have to be tightly coupled with the LED device binding. They are represented
by child nodes of the parent LED device binding.

Optional properties for child nodes:
- led-sources : List of device current outputs the LED is connected to. The
		outputs are identified by the numbers that must be defined
		in the LED device binding documentation.
- label : The label for this LED. If omitted, the label is taken from the node
	  name (excluding the unit address). It has to uniquely identify
	  a device, i.e. no other LED class device can be assigned the same
	  label.

- linux,default-trigger :  This parameter, if present, is a
    string defining the trigger assigned to the LED.  Current triggers are:
     "backlight" - LED will act as a back-light, controlled by the framebuffer
		   system
     "default-on" - LED will turn on (but for leds-gpio see "default-state"
		    property in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/led.txt)
     "heartbeat" - LED "double" flashes at a load average based rate
     "ide-disk" - LED indicates disk activity
     "timer" - LED flashes at a fixed, configurable rate

- max-microamp : maximum intensity in microamperes of the LED
		 (torch LED for flash devices)
- flash-max-microamp : maximum intensity in microamperes of the
                       flash LED; it is mandatory if the LED should
		       support the flash mode
- flash-timeout-us : timeout in microseconds after which the flash
                     LED is turned off


Examples:

system-status {
	label = "Status";
	linux,default-trigger = "heartbeat";
	...
};

camera-flash {
	label = "Flash";
	led-sources = <0>, <1>;
	max-microamp = <50000>;
	flash-max-microamp = <320000>;
	flash-timeout-us = <500000>;
};
