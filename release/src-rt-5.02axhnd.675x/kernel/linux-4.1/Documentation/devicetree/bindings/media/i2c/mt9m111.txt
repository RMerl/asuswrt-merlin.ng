The Micron MT9M111 is a CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with an active
array size of 1280H x 1024V. It is programmable through a simple two-wire serial
interface.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be "micron,mt9m111"

For further reading on port node refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	i2c_master {
		mt9m111@5d {
			compatible = "micron,mt9m111";
			reg = <0x5d>;

			remote = <&pxa_camera>;
			port {
				mt9m111_1: endpoint {
					bus-width = <8>;
					remote-endpoint = <&pxa_camera>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
