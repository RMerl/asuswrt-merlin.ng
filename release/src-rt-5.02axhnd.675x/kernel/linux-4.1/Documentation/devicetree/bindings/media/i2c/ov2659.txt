* OV2659 1/5-Inch 2Mp SOC Camera

The Omnivision OV2659 is a 1/5-inch SOC camera, with an active array size of
1632H x 1212V. It is programmable through a SCCB. The OV2659 sensor supports
multiple resolutions output, such as UXGA, SVGA, 720p. It also can support
YUV422, RGB565/555 or raw RGB output formats.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Must be "ovti,ov2659"
- reg: I2C slave address
- clocks: reference to the xvclk input clock.
- clock-names: should be "xvclk".
- link-frequencies: target pixel clock frequency.

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	i2c0@1c22000 {
		...
		...
		 ov2659@30 {
			compatible = "ovti,ov2659";
			reg = <0x30>;

			clocks = <&clk_ov2659 0>;
			clock-names = "xvclk";

			port {
				ov2659_0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&vpfe_ep>;
					link-frequencies = /bits/ 64 <70000000>;
				};
			};
		};
		...
	};
