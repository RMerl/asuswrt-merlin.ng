* Meta Processor Binding

This binding specifies what properties must be available in the device tree
representation of a Meta Processor Core, which is the root node in the tree.

Required properties:

    - compatible: Specifies the compatibility list for the Meta processor.
      The type shall be <string> and the value shall include "img,meta".

Optional properties:

    - clocks: Clock consumer specifiers as described in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

    - clock-names: Clock consumer names as described in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt.

Clocks are identified by name. Valid clocks are:

    - "core": The Meta core clock from which the Meta timers are derived.

* Examples

/ {
	compatible = "toumaz,tz1090", "img,meta";

	clocks = <&meta_core_clk>;
	clock-names = "core";
};
