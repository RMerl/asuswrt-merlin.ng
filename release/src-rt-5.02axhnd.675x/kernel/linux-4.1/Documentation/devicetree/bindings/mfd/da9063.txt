* Dialog DA9063 Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC)

DA9093 consists of a large and varied group of sub-devices (I2C Only):

Device                   Supply Names    Description
------                   ------------    -----------
da9063-regulator        :               : LDOs & BUCKs
da9063-rtc              :               : Real-Time Clock
da9063-watchdog         :               : Watchdog

======

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "dlg,da9063"
- reg : Specifies the I2C slave address (this defaults to 0x58 but it can be
  modified to match the chip's OTP settings).
- interrupt-parent : Specifies the reference to the interrupt controller for
  the DA9063.
- interrupts : IRQ line information.
- interrupt-controller

Sub-nodes:

- regulators : This node defines the settings for the LDOs and BUCKs. The
  DA9063 regulators are bound using their names listed below:

    bcore1    : BUCK CORE1
    bcore2    : BUCK CORE2
    bpro      : BUCK PRO
    bmem      : BUCK MEM
    bio       : BUCK IO
    bperi     : BUCK PERI
    ldo1      : LDO_1
    ldo2      : LDO_2
    ldo3      : LDO_3
    ldo4      : LDO_4
    ldo5      : LDO_5
    ldo6      : LDO_6
    ldo7      : LDO_7
    ldo8      : LDO_8
    ldo9      : LDO_9
    ldo10     : LDO_10
    ldo11     : LDO_11

  The component follows the standard regulator framework and the bindings
  details of individual regulator device can be found in:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

- rtc : This node defines settings for the Real-Time Clock associated with
  the DA9063. There are currently no entries in this binding, however
  compatible = "dlg,da9063-rtc" should be added if a node is created.

- watchdog : This node defines settings for the Watchdog timer associated
  with the DA9063. There are currently no entries in this binding, however
  compatible = "dlg,da9063-watchdog" should be added if a node is created.


Example:

	pmic0: da9063@58 {
		compatible = "dlg,da9063"
		reg = <0x58>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio6>;
		interrupts = <11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;

		rtc {
			compatible = "dlg,da9063-rtc";
		};

		wdt {
			compatible = "dlg,da9063-watchdog";
		};

		regulators {
			DA9063_BCORE1: bcore1 {
				regulator-name = "BCORE1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <300000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1570000>;
				regulator-min-microamp = <500000>;
				regulator-max-microamp = <2000000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
			DA9063_LDO11: ldo11 {
				regulator-name = "LDO_11";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3600000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
		};
	};
