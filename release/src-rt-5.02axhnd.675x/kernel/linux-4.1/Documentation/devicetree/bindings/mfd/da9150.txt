Dialog Semiconductor DA9150 Combined Charger/Fuel-Gauge MFD bindings

DA9150 consists of a group of sub-devices:

Device			 Description
------			 -----------
da9150-gpadc		: General Purpose ADC
da9150-charger		: Battery Charger

======

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "dlg,da9150"
- reg: Specifies the I2C slave address
- interrupt-parent: Specifies the phandle of the interrupt controller to which
  the IRQs from da9150 are delivered to.
- interrupts: IRQ line info for da9150 chip.
- interrupt-controller: da9150 has internal IRQs (own IRQ domain).
  (See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for
   further information relating to interrupt properties)

Sub-devices:
- da9150-gpadc: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/adc/da9150-gpadc.txt
- da9150-charger: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/da9150-charger.txt


Example:

	charger_fg: da9150@58 {
		compatible = "dlg,da9150";
		reg = <0x58>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio6>;
		interrupts = <11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;

		gpadc: da9150-gpadc {
			...
		};

		da9150-charger {
			...
		};
	};
