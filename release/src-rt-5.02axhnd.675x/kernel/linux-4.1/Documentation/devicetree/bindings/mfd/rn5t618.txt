* Ricoh RN5T618 PMIC

Ricoh RN5T618 is a power management IC which integrates 3 step-down
DCDC converters, 7 low-dropout regulators, a Li-ion battery charger,
fuel gauge, ADC, GPIOs and a watchdog timer. It can be controlled
through a I2C interface.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "ricoh,rn5t618"
 - reg: the I2C slave address of the device

Sub-nodes:
 - regulators: the node is required if the regulator functionality is
   needed. The valid regulator names are: DCDC1, DCDC2, DCDC3, LDO1,
   LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDORTC1 and LDORTC2.
   The common bindings for each individual regulator can be found in:
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Example:

	pmic@32 {
		compatible = "ricoh,rn5t618";
		reg = <0x32>;

		regulators {
			DCDC1 {
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1050000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1050000>;
			};

			DCDC2 {
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1175000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1175000>;
			};
		};
	};
