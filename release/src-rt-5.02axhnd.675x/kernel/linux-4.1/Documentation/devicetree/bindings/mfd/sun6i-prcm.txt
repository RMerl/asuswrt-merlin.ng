* Allwinner PRCM (Power/Reset/Clock Management) Multi-Functional Device

PRCM is an MFD device exposing several Power Management related devices
(like clks and reset controllers).

Required properties:
 - compatible: "allwinner,sun6i-a31-prcm" or "allwinner,sun8i-a23-prcm"
 - reg: The PRCM registers range

The prcm node may contain several subdevices definitions:
 - see Documentation/devicetree/clk/sunxi.txt for clock devices
 - see Documentation/devicetree/reset/allwinner,sunxi-clock-reset.txt for reset
   controller devices


Example:

	prcm: prcm@01f01400 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun6i-a31-prcm";
		reg = <0x01f01400 0x200>;

		/* Put subdevices here */
		ar100: ar100_clk {
			compatible = "allwinner,sun6i-a31-ar100-clk";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&osc32k>, <&osc24M>, <&pll6>, <&pll6>;
		};

		ahb0: ahb0_clk {
			compatible = "fixed-factor-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-div = <1>;
			clock-mult = <1>;
			clocks = <&ar100_div>;
			clock-output-names = "ahb0";
		};

		apb0: apb0_clk {
			compatible = "allwinner,sun6i-a31-apb0-clk";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&ahb0>;
			clock-output-names = "apb0";
		};

		apb0_gates: apb0_gates_clk {
			compatible = "allwinner,sun6i-a31-apb0-gates-clk";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&apb0>;
			clock-output-names = "apb0_pio", "apb0_ir",
					"apb0_timer01", "apb0_p2wi",
					"apb0_uart", "apb0_1wire",
					"apb0_i2c";
		};

		apb0_rst: apb0_rst {
			compatible = "allwinner,sun6i-a31-clock-reset";
			#reset-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
