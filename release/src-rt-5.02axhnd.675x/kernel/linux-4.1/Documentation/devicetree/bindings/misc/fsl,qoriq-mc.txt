* Freescale Management Complex

The Freescale Management Complex (fsl-mc) is a hardware resource
manager that manages specialized hardware objects used in
network-oriented packet processing applications. After the fsl-mc
block is enabled, pools of hardware resources are available, such as
queues, buffer pools, I/O interfaces. These resources are building
blocks that can be used to create functional hardware objects/devices
such as network interfaces, crypto accelerator instances, L2 switches,
etc.

Required properties:

    - compatible
        Value type: <string>
        Definition: Must be "fsl,qoriq-mc".  A Freescale Management Complex
                    compatible with this binding must have Block Revision
                    Registers BRR1 and BRR2 at offset 0x0BF8 and 0x0BFC in
                    the MC control register region.

    - reg
        Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
        Definition: A standard property.  Specifies one or two regions
                    defining the MC's registers:

                       -the first region is the command portal for the
                        this machine and must always be present

                       -the second region is the MC control registers. This
                        region may not be present in some scenarios, such
                        as in the device tree presented to a virtual machine.

Example:

        fsl_mc: fsl-mc@80c000000 {
                compatible = "fsl,qoriq-mc";
                reg = <0x00000008 0x0c000000 0 0x40>,    /* MC portal base */
                      <0x00000000 0x08340000 0 0x40000>; /* MC control reg */
        };
