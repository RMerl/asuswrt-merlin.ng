Broadcom BCM2835 SDHCI controller

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties that represent the BCM2835 controller.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "brcm,bcm2835-sdhci".
- clocks : The clock feeding the SDHCI controller.

Example:

sdhci: sdhci {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-sdhci";
	reg = <0x7e300000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <2 30>;
	clocks = <&clk_mmc>;
	bus-width = <4>;
};
