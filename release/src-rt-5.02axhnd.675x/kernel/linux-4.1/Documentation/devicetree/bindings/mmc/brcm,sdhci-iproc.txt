Broadcom IPROC SDHCI controller

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties that represent the IPROC SDHCI controller.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "brcm,sdhci-iproc-cygnus".
- clocks : The clock feeding the SDHCI controller.

Optional properties:
  - sdhci,auto-cmd12: specifies that controller should use auto CMD12.

Example:

sdhci0: sdhci@0x18041000 {
	compatible = "brcm,sdhci-iproc-cygnus";
	reg = <0x18041000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 108 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&lcpll0_clks BCM_CYGNUS_LCPLL0_SDIO_CLK>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	sdhci,auto-cmd12;
	no-1-8-v;
};
