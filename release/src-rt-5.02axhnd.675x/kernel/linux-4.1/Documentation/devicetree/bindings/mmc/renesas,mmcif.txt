* Renesas Multi Media Card Interface (MMCIF) Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the MMCIF device.


Required properties:

- compatible: must contain one of the following
	- "renesas,mmcif-r8a7740" for the MMCIF found in r8a7740 SoCs
	- "renesas,mmcif-r8a7790" for the MMCIF found in r8a7790 SoCs
	- "renesas,mmcif-r8a7791" for the MMCIF found in r8a7791 SoCs
	- "renesas,sh-mmcif" for the generic MMCIF

- clocks: reference to the functional clock

- dmas: reference to the DMA channels, one per channel name listed in the
  dma-names property.
- dma-names: must contain "tx" for the transmit DMA channel and "rx" for the
  receive DMA channel.


Example: R8A7790 (R-Car H2) MMCIF0

	mmcif0: mmc@ee200000 {
		compatible = "renesas,mmcif-r8a7790", "renesas,sh-mmcif";
		reg = <0 0xee200000 0 0x80>;
		interrupts = <0 169 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp3_clks R8A7790_CLK_MMCIF0>;
		dmas = <&dmac0 0xd1>, <&dmac0 0xd2>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
