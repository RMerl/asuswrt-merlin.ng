* Rockchip specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Rockchip specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "rockchip,rk2928-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK2928 and following,
							before RK3288
	- "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3288

Example:

	rkdwmmc0@12200000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x12200000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 75 0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
