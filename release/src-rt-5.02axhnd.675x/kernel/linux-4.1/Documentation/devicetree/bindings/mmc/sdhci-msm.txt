* Qualcomm SDHCI controller (sdhci-msm)

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-msm driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "qcom,sdhci-msm-v4".
- reg: Base address and length of the register in the following order:
	- Host controller register map (required)
	- SD Core register map (required)
- interrupts: Should contain an interrupt-specifiers for the interrupts:
	- Host controller interrupt (required)
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".
- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the clocks listed in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain the following:
	"iface" - Main peripheral bus clock (PCLK/HCLK - AHB Bus clock) (required)
	"core"	- SDC MMC clock (MCLK) (required)
	"bus"	- SDCC bus voter clock (optional)

Example:

	sdhc_1: sdhci@f9824900 {
		compatible = "qcom,sdhci-msm-v4";
		reg = <0xf9824900 0x11c>, <0xf9824000 0x800>;
		interrupts = <0 123 0>;
		bus-width = <8>;
		non-removable;

		vmmc-supply = <&pm8941_l20>;
		vqmmc-supply = <&pm8941_s3>;

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sdc1_clk &sdc1_cmd &sdc1_data>;

		clocks = <&gcc GCC_SDCC1_APPS_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_SDCC1_AHB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "core", "iface";
	};

	sdhc_2: sdhci@f98a4900 {
		compatible = "qcom,sdhci-msm-v4";
		reg = <0xf98a4900 0x11c>, <0xf98a4000 0x800>;
		interrupts = <0 125 0>;
		bus-width = <4>;
		cd-gpios = <&msmgpio 62 0x1>;

		vmmc-supply = <&pm8941_l21>;
		vqmmc-supply = <&pm8941_l13>;

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sdc2_clk &sdc2_cmd &sdc2_data>;

		clocks = <&gcc GCC_SDCC2_APPS_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_SDCC2_AHB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "core", "iface";
	};
