Flexcan CAN controller on Freescale's ARM and PowerPC system-on-a-chip (SOC).

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "fsl,<processor>-flexcan"

  An implementation should also claim any of the following compatibles
  that it is fully backwards compatible with:

  - fsl,p1010-flexcan

- reg : Offset and length of the register set for this device
- interrupts : Interrupt tuple for this device

Optional properties:

- clock-frequency : The oscillator frequency driving the flexcan device

- xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver

Example:

	can@1c000 {
		compatible = "fsl,p1010-flexcan";
		reg = <0x1c000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <48 0x2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
		clock-frequency = <200000000>; // filled in by bootloader
	};
