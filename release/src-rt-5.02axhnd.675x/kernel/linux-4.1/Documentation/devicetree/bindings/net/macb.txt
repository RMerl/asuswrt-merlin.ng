* Cadence MACB/GEM Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "cdns,[<chip>-]{macb|gem}"
  Use "cdns,at91sam9260-macb" for Atmel at91sam9 SoCs or the 10/100Mbit IP
  available on sama5d3 SoCs.
  Use "cdns,at32ap7000-macb" for other 10/100 usage or use the generic form: "cdns,macb".
  Use "cdns,pc302-gem" for Picochip picoXcell pc302 and later devices based on
  the Cadence GEM, or the generic form: "cdns,gem".
  Use "cdns,sama5d3-gem" for the Gigabit IP available on Atmel sama5d3 SoCs.
  Use "cdns,sama5d4-gem" for the Gigabit IP available on Atmel sama5d4 SoCs.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain macb interrupt
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- clock-names: Tuple listing input clock names.
	Required elements: 'pclk', 'hclk'
	Optional elements: 'tx_clk'
- clocks: Phandles to input clocks.

Examples:

	macb0: ethernet@fffc4000 {
		compatible = "cdns,at32ap7000-macb";
		reg = <0xfffc4000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <21>;
		phy-mode = "rmii";
		local-mac-address = [3a 0e 03 04 05 06];
		clock-names = "pclk", "hclk", "tx_clk";
		clocks = <&clkc 30>, <&clkc 30>, <&clkc 13>;
	};
