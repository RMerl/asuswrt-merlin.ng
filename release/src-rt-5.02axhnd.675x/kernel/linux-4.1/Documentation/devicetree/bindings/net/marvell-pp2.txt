* Marvell Armada 375 Ethernet Controller (PPv2)

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-375-pp2"
- reg: addresses and length of the register sets for the device.
  Must contain the following register sets:
	- common controller registers
	- LMS registers
  In addition, at least one port register set is required.
- clocks: a pointer to the reference clocks for this device, consequently:
	- main controller clock
	- GOP clock
- clock-names: names of used clocks, must be "pp_clk" and "gop_clk".

The ethernet ports are represented by subnodes. At least one port is
required.

Required properties (port):

- interrupts: interrupt for the port
- port-id: should be '0' or '1' for ethernet ports, and '2' for the
           loopback port
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Optional properties (port):

- marvell,loopback: port is loopback mode
- phy: a phandle to a phy node defining the PHY address (as the reg
  property, a single integer). Note: if this property isn't present,
  then fixed link is assumed, and the 'fixed-link' property is
  mandatory.

Example:

ethernet@f0000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-375-pp2";
	reg = <0xf0000 0xa000>,
	      <0xc0000 0x3060>,
	      <0xc4000 0x100>,
	      <0xc5000 0x100>;
	clocks = <&gateclk 3>, <&gateclk 19>;
	clock-names = "pp_clk", "gop_clk";
	status = "okay";

	eth0: eth0@c4000 {
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 37 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		port-id = <0>;
		status = "okay";
		phy = <&phy0>;
		phy-mode = "gmii";
	};

	eth1: eth1@c5000 {
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 41 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		port-id = <1>;
		status = "okay";
		phy = <&phy3>;
		phy-mode = "gmii";
	};
};
