* Amlogic Meson DWMAC Ethernet controller

The device inherits all the properties of the dwmac/stmmac devices
described in the file net/stmmac.txt with the following changes.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "amlogic,meson6-dwmac" along with "snps,dwmac"
	      and any applicable more detailed version number
	      described in net/stmmac.txt

- reg: should contain a register range for the dwmac controller and
       another one for the Amlogic specific configuration

Example:

	ethmac: ethernet@c9410000 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson6-dwmac", "snps,dwmac";
		reg = <0xc9410000 0x10000
		       0xc1108108 0x4>;
		interrupts = <0 8 1>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq";
		clocks = <&clk81>;
		clock-names = "stmmaceth";
	}
