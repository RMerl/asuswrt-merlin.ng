* Smart Mixed-Signal Connectivity (SMSC) LAN911x/912x Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "smsc,lan<model>", "smsc,lan9115"
- reg : Address and length of the io space for SMSC LAN
- interrupts : Should contain SMSC LAN interrupt line
- interrupt-parent : Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- phy-mode : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Optional properties:
- reg-shift : Specify the quantity to shift the register offsets by
- reg-io-width : Specify the size (in bytes) of the IO accesses that
  should be performed on the device.  Valid value for SMSC LAN is
  2 or 4.  If it's omitted or invalid, the size would be 2.
- smsc,irq-active-high : Indicates the IRQ polarity is active-high
- smsc,irq-push-pull : Indicates the IRQ type is push-pull
- smsc,force-internal-phy : Forces SMSC LAN controller to use
  internal PHY
- smsc,force-external-phy : Forces SMSC LAN controller to use
  external PHY
- smsc,save-mac-address : Indicates that mac address needs to be saved
  before resetting the controller

Examples:

lan9220@f4000000 {
	compatible = "smsc,lan9220", "smsc,lan9115";
	reg = <0xf4000000 0x2000000>;
	phy-mode = "mii";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <31>;
	reg-io-width = <4>;
	smsc,irq-push-pull;
};
