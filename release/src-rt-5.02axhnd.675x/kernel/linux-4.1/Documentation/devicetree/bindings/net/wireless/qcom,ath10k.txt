* Qualcomm Atheros ath10k wireless devices

For ath10k devices the calibration data can be provided through Device
Tree. The node is a child node of the PCI controller.

Required properties:
-compatible : Should be "qcom,ath10k"

Optional properties:
- qcom,ath10k-calibration-data : calibration data as an array, the
				 length can vary between hw versions


Example:

pci {
	pcie@0 {
		reg = <0 0 0 0 0>;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		#address-cells = <3>;
		device_type = "pci";

		ath10k@0,0 {
			reg = <0 0 0 0 0>;
			device_type = "pci";
			qcom,ath10k-calibration-data = [ 01 02 03 ... ];
		};
	};
};
