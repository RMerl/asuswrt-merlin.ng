* Texas Instruments wl1251 wireless lan controller

The wl1251 chip can be connected via SPI or via SDIO. This
document describes the binding for the SPI connected chip.

Required properties:
- compatible :        Should be "ti,wl1251"
- reg :               Chip select address of device
- spi-max-frequency : Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz
- interrupts :        Should contain interrupt line
- interrupt-parent :  Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
                      that services interrupts for this device
- vio-supply :        phandle to regulator providing VIO
- ti,power-gpio :     GPIO connected to chip's PMEN pin

Optional properties:
- ti,wl1251-has-eeprom : boolean, the wl1251 has an eeprom connected, which
                         provides configuration data (calibration, MAC, ...)
- Please consult Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
  for optional SPI connection related properties,

Examples:

&spi1 {
	wl1251@0 {
		compatible = "ti,wl1251";

		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <48000000>;
		spi-cpol;
		spi-cpha;

		interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
		interrupts = <10 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>; /* gpio line 42 */

		vio-supply = <&vio>;
		ti,power-gpio = <&gpio3 23 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* 87 */
	};
};
