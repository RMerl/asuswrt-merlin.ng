V3 Semiconductor V360 EPC PCI bridge

This bridge is found in the ARM Integrator/AP (Application Platform)

Integrator-specific notes:

- syscon: should contain a link to the syscon device node (since
  on the Integrator, some registers in the syscon are required to
  operate the V3).

V360 EPC specific notes:

- reg: should contain the base address of the V3 adapter.
- interrupts: should contain a reference to the V3 error interrupt
  as routed on the system.
