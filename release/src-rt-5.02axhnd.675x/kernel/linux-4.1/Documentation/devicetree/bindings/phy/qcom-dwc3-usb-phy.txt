Qualcomm DWC3 HS AND SS PHY CONTROLLER
--------------------------------------

DWC3 PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip Synopsis Physical layer
controllers.  Each DWC3 PHY controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain one of the following:
	- "qcom,dwc3-hs-usb-phy" for High Speed Synopsis PHY controller
	- "qcom,dwc3-ss-usb-phy" for Super Speed Synopsis PHY controller
- reg: offset and length of the DWC3 PHY controller register set
- #phy-cells: must be zero
- clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry in
  clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain "ref" for the PHY reference clock

Optional clocks:
  "xo"		External reference clock

Example:
		phy@100f8800 {
			compatible = "qcom,dwc3-hs-usb-phy";
			reg = <0x100f8800 0x30>;
			clocks = <&gcc USB30_0_UTMI_CLK>;
			clock-names = "ref";
			#phy-cells = <0>;

			status = "ok";
		};

		phy@100f8830 {
			compatible = "qcom,dwc3-ss-usb-phy";
			reg = <0x100f8830 0x30>;
			clocks = <&gcc USB30_0_MASTER_CLK>;
			clock-names = "ref";
			#phy-cells = <0>;

			status = "ok";
		};
