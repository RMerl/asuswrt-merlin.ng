Allwinner sun9i USB PHY
-----------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of
  * allwinner,sun9i-a80-usb-phy
- reg : a list of offset + length pairs
- #phy-cells : from the generic phy bindings, must be 0
- phy_type : "hsic" for HSIC usage;
	     other values or absence of this property indicates normal USB
- clocks : phandle + clock specifier for the phy clocks
- clock-names : depending on the "phy_type" property,
  * "phy" for normal USB
  * "hsic_480M", "hsic_12M" for HSIC
- resets : a list of phandle + reset specifier pairs
- reset-names : depending on the "phy_type" property,
  * "phy" for normal USB
  * "hsic" for HSIC

Optional Properties:
- phy-supply : from the generic phy bindings, a phandle to a regulator that
	       provides power to VBUS.

It is recommended to list all clocks and resets available.
The driver will only use those matching the phy_type.

Example:
	usbphy1: phy@00a01800 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun9i-a80-usb-phy";
		reg = <0x00a01800 0x4>;
		clocks = <&usb_phy_clk 2>, <&usb_phy_clk 10>,
		       <&usb_phy_clk 3>;
		clock-names = "hsic_480M", "hsic_12M", "phy";
		resets = <&usb_phy_clk 18>, <&usb_phy_clk 19>;
		reset-names = "hsic", "phy";
		status = "disabled";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
	};
