* Renesas R-Car Timer Pulse Unit PWM Controller

Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a73a4": for R8A77A4 (R-Mobile APE6) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a7740": for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a7790": for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-sh7372": for SH7372 (SH-Mobile AP4) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu": for generic R-Car TPU PWM controller.

  - reg: Base address and length of each memory resource used by the PWM
    controller hardware module.

  - #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format. The only third cell flag supported by this binding is
    PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED.

Please refer to pwm.txt in this directory for details of the common PWM bindings
used by client devices.

Example: R8A7740 (R-Car A1) TPU controller node

	tpu: pwm@e6600000 {
		compatible = "renesas,tpu-r8a7740", "renesas,tpu";
		reg = <0xe6600000 0x100>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
	};
