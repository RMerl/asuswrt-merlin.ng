This binding supports the following chips: i.MX25, i.MX53

Required properties:
- compatible: should be: "fsl,imx25-rtc"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: rtc alarm interrupt

Example:

rtc@80056000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx53-rtc", "fsl,imx25-rtc";
	reg = <0x80056000 2000>;
	interrupts = <29>;
};
