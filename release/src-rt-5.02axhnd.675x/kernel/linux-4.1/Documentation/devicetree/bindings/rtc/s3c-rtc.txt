* Samsung's S3C Real Time Clock controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * "samsung,s3c2410-rtc" - for controllers compatible with s3c2410 rtc.
    * "samsung,s3c2416-rtc" - for controllers compatible with s3c2416 rtc.
    * "samsung,s3c2443-rtc" - for controllers compatible with s3c2443 rtc.
    * "samsung,s3c6410-rtc" - for controllers compatible with s3c6410 rtc.
    * "samsung,exynos3250-rtc" - for controllers compatible with exynos3250 rtc.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: Two interrupt numbers to the cpu should be specified. First
  interrupt number is the rtc alarm interrupt and second interrupt number
  is the rtc tick interrupt. The number of cells representing a interrupt
  depends on the parent interrupt controller.

Example:

	rtc@10070000 {
		compatible = "samsung,s3c6410-rtc";
		reg = <0x10070000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <44 0 45 0>;
	};
