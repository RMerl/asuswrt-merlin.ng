* Qualcomm Atheros AR9330 High-Speed UART

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "qca,ar9330-uart"

- reg: Specifies the physical base address of the controller and
  the length of the memory mapped region.

- interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller that
  services interrupts for this device.

- interrupts: Specifies the interrupt source of the parent interrupt
  controller. The format of the interrupt specifier depends on the
  parent interrupt controller.

Additional requirements:

  Each UART port must have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
  node.

Example:

	aliases {
		serial0 = &uart0;
	};

	uart0: uart@18020000 {
		compatible = "qca,ar9330-uart";
		reg = <0x18020000 0x14>;

		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <3>;
	};
