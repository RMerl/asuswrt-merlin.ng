* Device tree bindings for Allwinner A10, A20 PS2 host controller

A20 PS2 is dual role controller (PS2 host and PS2 device). These bindings are
for PS2 A10/A20 host controller. IBM compliant IBM PS2 and AT-compatible keyboard

Required properties:

 - reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
 - compatible      : Should be as of the following:
                     - "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ps2"
 - interrupts      : The interrupt line connected to the PS2.
 - clocks          : The gate clk connected to the PS2.


Example:
	ps20: ps2@0x01c2a000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ps2";
		reg = <0x01c2a000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 62 4>;
		clocks = <&apb1_gates 6>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
