Freescale i.MX audio complex with WM8962 codec

Required properties:

  - compatible		: "fsl,imx-audio-wm8962"

  - model		: The user-visible name of this sound complex

  - ssi-controller	: The phandle of the i.MX SSI controller

  - audio-codec		: The phandle of the WM8962 audio codec

  - audio-routing	: A list of the connections between audio components.
			  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
			  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			  source. Valid names could be power supplies, WM8962
			  pins, and the jacks on the board:

			  Power supplies:
			   * Mic Bias

			  Board connectors:
			   * Mic Jack
			   * Headphone Jack
			   * Ext Spk

  - mux-int-port	: The internal port of the i.MX audio muxer (AUDMUX)

  - mux-ext-port	: The external port of the i.MX audio muxer

Note: The AUDMUX port numbering should start at 1, which is consistent with
hardware manual.

Example:

sound {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-sabresd-wm8962",
		     "fsl,imx-audio-wm8962";
	model = "wm8962-audio";
	ssi-controller = <&ssi2>;
	audio-codec = <&codec>;
		audio-routing =
		"Headphone Jack", "HPOUTL",
		"Headphone Jack", "HPOUTR",
		"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTL",
		"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTR",
		"MICBIAS", "AMIC",
		"IN3R", "MICBIAS",
		"DMIC", "MICBIAS",
		"DMICDAT", "DMIC";
	mux-int-port = <2>;
	mux-ext-port = <3>;
};
