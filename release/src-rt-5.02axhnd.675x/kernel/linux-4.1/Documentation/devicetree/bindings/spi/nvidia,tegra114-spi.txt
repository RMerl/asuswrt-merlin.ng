NVIDIA Tegra114 SPI controller.

Required properties:
- compatible : For Tegra114, must contain "nvidia,tegra114-spi".
  Otherwise, must contain '"nvidia,<chip>-spi", "nvidia,tegra114-spi"' where
  <chip> is tegra124, tegra132, or tegra210.
- reg: Should contain SPI registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain SPI interrupts.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  - spi
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
  - spi
- dmas : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../dma/dma.txt for details.
- dma-names : Must include the following entries:
  - rx
  - tx
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.

Recommended properties:
- spi-max-frequency: Definition as per
                     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
Example:

spi@7000d600 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra114-spi";
	reg = <0x7000d600 0x200>;
	interrupts = <0 82 0x04>;
	spi-max-frequency = <25000000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	clocks = <&tegra_car 44>;
	clock-names = "spi";
	resets = <&tegra_car 44>;
	reset-names = "spi";
	dmas = <&apbdma 16>, <&apbdma 16>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
	status = "disabled";
};
