Amlogic Meson SPI controllers

* SPIFC (SPI Flash Controller)

The Meson SPIFC is a controller optimized for communication with SPI
NOR memories, without DMA support and a 64-byte unified transmit /
receive buffer.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "amlogic,meson6-spifc"
 - reg: physical base address and length of the controller registers
 - clocks: phandle of the input clock for the baud rate generator
 - #address-cells: should be 1
 - #size-cells: should be 0

	spi@c1108c80 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson6-spifc";
		reg = <0xc1108c80 0x80>;
		clocks = <&clk81>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
