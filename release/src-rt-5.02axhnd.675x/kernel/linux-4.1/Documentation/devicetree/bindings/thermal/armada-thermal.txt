* Marvell Armada 370/375/380/XP thermal management

Required properties:

- compatible:	Should be set to one of the following:
		marvell,armada370-thermal
		marvell,armada375-thermal
		marvell,armada380-thermal
		marvell,armadaxp-thermal

- reg:		Device's register space.
		Two entries are expected, see the examples below.
		The first one is required for the sensor register;
		the second one is required for the control register
		to be used for sensor initialization (a.k.a. calibration).

Example:

	thermal@d0018300 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada370-thermal";
                reg = <0xd0018300 0x4
		       0xd0018304 0x4>;
		status = "okay";
	};
