* Temperature Monitor (TEMPMON) on Freescale i.MX SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,imx6q-tempmon" for i.MX6Q, "fsl,imx6sx-tempmon" for i.MX6SX.
  i.MX6SX has two more IRQs than i.MX6Q, one is IRQ_LOW and the other is IRQ_PANIC,
  when temperature is below than low threshold, IRQ_LOW will be triggered, when temperature
  is higher than panic threshold, system will auto reboot by SRC module.
- fsl,tempmon : phandle pointer to system controller that contains TEMPMON
  control registers, e.g. ANATOP on imx6q.
- fsl,tempmon-data : phandle pointer to fuse controller that contains TEMPMON
  calibration data, e.g. OCOTP on imx6q.  The details about calibration data
  can be found in SoC Reference Manual.

Optional properties:
- clocks : thermal sensor's clock source.

Example:

tempmon {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-tempmon";
	fsl,tempmon = <&anatop>;
	fsl,tempmon-data = <&ocotp>;
	clocks = <&clks 172>;
};
