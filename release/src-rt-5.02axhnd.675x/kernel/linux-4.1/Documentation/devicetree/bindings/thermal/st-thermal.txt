Binding for Thermal Sensor driver for STMicroelectronics STi series of SoCs.

Required parameters:
-------------------

compatible : 	st,<SoC>-<module>-thermal; should be one of:
		  "st,stih415-sas-thermal",
		  "st,stih415-mpe-thermal",
		  "st,stih416-sas-thermal"
		  "st,stih416-mpe-thermal"
		  "st,stid127-thermal" or
		  "st,stih407-thermal"
		according to the SoC type (stih415, stih416, stid127, stih407)
		and module type (sas or mpe). On stid127 & stih407 there is only
		one die/module, so there is no module type in the compatible
		string.
clock-names : 	Should be "thermal".
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
clocks : 	Phandle of the clock used by the thermal sensor.
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional parameters:
-------------------

reg : 		For non-sysconf based sensors, this should be the physical base
		address and length of the sensor's registers.
interrupts :	Standard way to define interrupt number.
		Interrupt is mandatory to be defined when compatible is
		"stih416-mpe-thermal".
		  NB: For thermal sensor's for which no interrupt has been
		  defined, a polling delay of 1000ms will be used to read the
		  temperature from device.

Example:

	temp1@fdfe8000 {
		compatible	= "st,stih416-mpe-thermal";
		reg		= <0xfdfe8000 0x10>;
		clock-names	= "thermal";
		clocks		= <&clk_m_mpethsens>;
		interrupts	= <GIC_SPI 23 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	};
