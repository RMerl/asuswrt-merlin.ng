Tegra124 SOCTHERM thermal management system

The SOCTHERM IP block contains thermal sensors, support for polled
or interrupt-based thermal monitoring, CPU and GPU throttling based
on temperature trip points, and handling external overcurrent
notifications. It is also used to manage emergency shutdown in an
overheating situation.

Required properties :
- compatible : For Tegra124, must contain "nvidia,tegra124-soctherm".
  For Tegra132, must contain "nvidia,tegra132-soctherm".
  For Tegra210, must contain "nvidia,tegra210-soctherm".
- reg : Should contain 1 entry:
  - SOCTHERM register set
- interrupts : Defines the interrupt used by SOCTHERM
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  - tsensor
  - soctherm
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
  - soctherm
- #thermal-sensor-cells : Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description
    of this property. See <dt-bindings/thermal/tegra124-soctherm.h> for a
    list of valid values when referring to thermal sensors.


Example :

	soctherm@0,700e2000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-soctherm";
		reg = <0x0 0x700e2000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 48 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA124_CLK_TSENSOR>,
			<&tegra_car TEGRA124_CLK_SOC_THERM>;
		clock-names = "tsensor", "soctherm";
		resets = <&tegra_car 78>;
		reset-names = "soctherm";

		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	};

Example: referring to thermal sensors :

       thermal-zones {
                cpu {
                        polling-delay-passive = <1000>;
                        polling-delay = <1000>;

                        thermal-sensors =
                                <&soctherm TEGRA124_SOCTHERM_SENSOR_CPU>;
                };
	};
