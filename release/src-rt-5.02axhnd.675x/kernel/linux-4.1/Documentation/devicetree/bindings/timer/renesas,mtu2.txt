* Renesas Multi-Function Timer Pulse Unit 2 (MTU2)

The MTU2 is a multi-purpose, multi-channel timer/counter with configurable
clock inputs and programmable compare match.

Channels share hardware resources but their counter and compare match value
are independent. The MTU2 hardware supports five channels indexed from 0 to 4.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: must be one or more of the following:
    - "renesas,mtu2-r7s72100" for the r7s72100 MTU2
    - "renesas,mtu2" for any MTU2
      This is a fallback for the above renesas,mtu2-* entries

  - reg: base address and length of the registers block for the timer module.

  - interrupts: interrupt specifiers for the timer, one for each entry in
    interrupt-names.
  - interrupt-names: must contain one entry named "tgi?a" for each enabled
    channel, where "?" is the channel index expressed as one digit from "0" to
    "4".

  - clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
    in clock-names.
  - clock-names: must contain "fck" for the functional clock.


Example: R7S72100 (RZ/A1H) MTU2 node

	mtu2: timer@fcff0000 {
		compatible = "renesas,mtu2-r7s72100", "renesas,mtu2";
		reg = <0xfcff0000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 139 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 146 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 150 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 154 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <0 159 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "tgi0a", "tgi1a", "tgi2a", "tgi3a", "tgi4a";
		clocks = <&mstp3_clks R7S72100_CLK_MTU2>;
		clock-names = "fck";
	};
