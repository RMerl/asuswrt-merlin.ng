THine Electronics THC63LVDM83D LVDS serializer
----------------------------------------------

The THC63LVDM83D is an LVDS serializer designed to support pixel data
transmission between a host and a flat panel.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "thine,thc63lvdm83d"

Optional properties:

- pwdn-gpios: Power down control GPIO

Required nodes:

The THC63LVDM83D has two video ports. Their connections are modeled using the
OFgraph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for CMOS/TTL input
- Video port 1 for LVDS output


Example
-------

	lvds_enc: encoder@0 {
		compatible = "thine,thc63lvdm83d";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;

				lvds_enc_in: endpoint@0 {
					remote-endpoint = <&rgb_out>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;

				lvds_enc_out: endpoint@0 {
					remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
