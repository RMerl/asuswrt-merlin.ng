The Samsung's Watchdog controller is used for resuming system operation
after a preset amount of time during which the WDT reset event has not
occurred.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one among the following
	(a) "samsung,s3c2410-wdt" for Exynos4 and previous SoCs
	(b) "samsung,exynos5250-wdt" for Exynos5250
	(c) "samsung,exynos5420-wdt" for Exynos5420
	(c) "samsung,exynos7-wdt" for Exynos7

- reg : base physical address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region.
- interrupts : interrupt number to the cpu.
- samsung,syscon-phandle : reference to syscon node (This property required only
	in case of compatible being "samsung,exynos5250-wdt" or "samsung,exynos5420-wdt".
	In case of Exynos5250 and 5420 this property points to syscon node holding the PMU
	base address)

Optional properties:
- timeout-sec : contains the watchdog timeout in seconds.

Example:

watchdog@101D0000 {
	compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-wdt";
	reg = <0x101D0000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <0 42 0>;
	clocks = <&clock 336>;
	clock-names = "watchdog";
	samsung,syscon-phandle = <&pmu_syscon>;
};
