fmc-trivial
===========

The simple module fmc-trivial is just a simple client that registers an
interrupt handler. I used it to verify the basic mechanism of the FMC
bus and how interrupts worked.

The module implements the generic FMC parameters, so it can program a
different gateware file in each card. The whole list of parameters it
accepts are:

`busid='
`gateware='
     Generic parameters. See mezzanine.txt


This driver is worth reading, in my opinion.
