Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware montoring for Analog Devices ADM1075, ADM1275,
and ADM1276 Hot-Swap Controller and Digital Power Monitor.

ADM1075, ADM1275, and ADM1276 are hot-swap controllers that allow a circuit
board to be removed from or inserted into a live backplane. They also feature
current and voltage readback via an integrated 12-bit analog-to-digital
converter (ADC), accessed using a PMBus interface.

The driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.

The ADM1075, unlike many other PMBus devices, does not support internal voltage
or current scaling. Reported voltages, currents, and power are raw measurements,
and will typically have to be scaled.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details.


Sysfs entries
-------------

The following attributes are supported. Limits are read-write, history reset
attributes are write-only, all other attributes are read-only.

in1_label		"vin1" or "vout1" depending on chip variant and
			configuration. On ADM1075, vout1 reports the voltage on
			the VAUX pin.
in1_input		Measured voltage.
in1_min			Minimum Voltage.
in1_max			Maximum voltage.
in1_min_alarm		Voltage low alarm.
in1_max_alarm		Voltage high alarm.
in1_highest		Historical maximum voltage.
in1_reset_history	Write any value to reset history.

curr1_label		"iout1"
curr1_input		Measured current.
curr1_max		Maximum current.
curr1_max_alarm		Current high alarm.
curr1_lcrit		Critical minimum current. Depending on the chip
			configuration, either curr1_lcrit or curr1_crit is
			supported, but not both.
curr1_lcrit_alarm	Critical current low alarm.
curr1_crit		Critical maximum current. Depending on the chip
			configuration, either curr1_lcrit or curr1_crit is
			supported, but not both.
curr1_crit_alarm	Critical current high alarm.
curr1_highest		Historical maximum current.
curr1_reset_history	Write any value to reset history.

power1_label		"pin1"
power1_input		Input power.
power1_reset_history	Write any value to reset history.

			Power attributes are supported on ADM1075 and ADM1276
			only.
