Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware montoring for National Semiconductor / TI LM25056,
LM25063, LM25066, LM5064, and LM5066 Power Management, Monitoring, Control, and
Protection ICs.

The driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data.
