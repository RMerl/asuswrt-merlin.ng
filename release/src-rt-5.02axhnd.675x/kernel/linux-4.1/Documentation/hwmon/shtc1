Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Sensirion SHTC1 chip, a humidity and
temperature sensor. Temperature is measured in degrees celsius, relative
humidity is expressed as a percentage. Driver can be used as well for SHTW1
chip, which has the same electrical interface.

The device communicates with the I2C protocol. All sensors are set to I2C
address 0x70. See Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for methods to
instantiate the device.

There are two options configurable by means of shtc1_platform_data:
1. blocking (pull the I2C clock line down while performing the measurement) or
   non-blocking mode. Blocking mode will guarantee the fastest result but
   the I2C bus will be busy during that time. By default, non-blocking mode
   is used. Make sure clock-stretching works properly on your device if you
   want to use blocking mode.
2. high or low accuracy. High accuracy is used by default and using it is
   strongly recommended.
