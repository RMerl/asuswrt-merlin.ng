Linux I2C slave eeprom backend
==============================

by Wolfram Sang <wsa@sang-engineering.com> in 2014-15

This is a proof-of-concept backend which acts like an EEPROM on the connected
I2C bus. The memory contents can be modified from userspace via this file
located in sysfs:

	/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<device-direcory>/slave-eeprom

As of 2015, Linux doesn't support poll on binary sysfs files, so there is no
notfication when another master changed the content.
