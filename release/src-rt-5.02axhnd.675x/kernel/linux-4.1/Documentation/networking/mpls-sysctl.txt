/proc/sys/net/mpls/* Variables:

platform_labels - INTEGER
	Number of entries in the platform label table.  It is not
	possible to configure forwarding for label values equal to or
	greater than the number of platform labels.

	A dense utliziation of the entries in the platform label table
	is possible and expected aas the platform labels are locally
	allocated.

	If the number of platform label table entries is set to 0 no
	label will be recognized by the kernel and mpls forwarding
	will be disabled.

	Reducing this value will remove all label routing entries that
	no longer fit in the table.

	Possible values: 0 - 1048575
	Default: 0
