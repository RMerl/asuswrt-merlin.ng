	  size. This works well for buffers up to a few hundreds kilobytes, but
	  for larger buffers it just a waste of address space. Drivers which has
	  relatively small addressing window (like 64Mib) might run out of
	  virtual space with just a few allocations.

	  With this parameter you can specify the maximum PAGE_SIZE order for
	  DMA IOMMU buffers. Larger buffers will be aligned only to this
	  specified order. The order is expressed as a power of two multiplied
	  by the PAGE_SIZE.

	  When coming out of either a Wait for Interrupt (WFI) or a Wait for

	  Executing a SWP instruction to read-only memory does not set bit 11

	  recommended workaround.

config ARM_ERRATA_430973
	bool "ARM errata: Stale prediction on replaced interworking branch"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 430973 Cortex-A8
	  r1p* erratum. If a code sequence containing an ARM/Thumb
	  interworking branch is replaced with another code sequence at the
	  same virtual address, whether due to self-modifying code or virtual
	  to physical address re-mapping, Cortex-A8 does not recover from the
	  stale interworking branch prediction. This results in Cortex-A8
	  executing the new code sequence in the incorrect ARM or Thumb state.
	  The workaround enables the BTB/BTAC operations by setting ACTLR.IBE
	  and also flushes the branch target cache at every context switch.
	  Note that setting specific bits in the ACTLR register may not be
	  available in non-secure mode.

config ARM_ERRATA_458693
	bool "ARM errata: Processor deadlock when a false hazard is created"
	depends on CPU_V7
	depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 458693 Cortex-A8 (r2p0)
	  erratum. For very specific sequences of memory operations, it is
	  possible for a hazard condition intended for a cache line to instead
	  be incorrectly associated with a different cache line. This false
	  hazard might then cause a processor deadlock. The workaround enables
	  the L1 caching of the NEON accesses and disables the PLD instruction
	  in the ACTLR register. Note that setting specific bits in the ACTLR
	  register may not be available in non-secure mode.

config ARM_ERRATA_460075
	bool "ARM errata: Data written to the L2 cache can be overwritten with stale data"
	depends on CPU_V7
	depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 460075 Cortex-A8 (r2p0)
	  erratum. Any asynchronous access to the L2 cache may encounter a
	  situation in which recent store transactions to the L2 cache are lost
	  and overwritten with stale memory contents from external memory. The
	  workaround disables the write-allocate mode for the L2 cache via the
	  ACTLR register. Note that setting specific bits in the ACTLR register
	  may not be available in non-secure mode.

config ARM_ERRATA_742230
	bool "ARM errata: DMB operation may be faulty"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 742230 Cortex-A9
	  (r1p0..r2p2) erratum. Under rare circumstances, a DMB instruction
	  between two write operations may not ensure the correct visibility
	  ordering of the two writes. This workaround sets a specific bit in
	  the diagnostic register of the Cortex-A9 which causes the DMB
	  instruction to behave as a DSB, ensuring the correct behaviour of
	  the two writes.

config ARM_ERRATA_742231
	bool "ARM errata: Incorrect hazard handling in the SCU may lead to data corruption"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 742231 Cortex-A9
	  (r2p0..r2p2) erratum. Under certain conditions, specific to the
	  Cortex-A9 MPCore micro-architecture, two CPUs working in SMP mode,
	  accessing some data located in the same cache line, may get corrupted
	  data due to bad handling of the address hazard when the line gets
	  replaced from one of the CPUs at the same time as another CPU is
	  accessing it. This workaround sets specific bits in the diagnostic
	  register of the Cortex-A9 which reduces the linefill issuing
	  capabilities of the processor.

config ARM_ERRATA_643719
	bool "ARM errata: LoUIS bit field in CLIDR register is incorrect"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	default y
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 643719 Cortex-A9 (prior to
	  r1p0) erratum. On affected cores the LoUIS bit field of the CLIDR
	  register returns zero when it should return one. The workaround
	  corrects this value, ensuring cache maintenance operations which use
	  it behave as intended and avoiding data corruption.

config ARM_ERRATA_720789
	bool "ARM errata: TLBIASIDIS and TLBIMVAIS operations can broadcast a faulty ASID"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 720789 Cortex-A9 (prior to
	  r2p0) erratum. A faulty ASID can be sent to the other CPUs for the
	  broadcasted CP15 TLB maintenance operations TLBIASIDIS and TLBIMVAIS.
	  As a consequence of this erratum, some TLB entries which should be
	  invalidated are not, resulting in an incoherency in the system page
	  tables. The workaround changes the TLB flushing routines to invalidate
	  entries regardless of the ASID.

config ARM_ERRATA_743622
	bool "ARM errata: Faulty hazard checking in the Store Buffer may lead to data corruption"
	depends on CPU_V7
	depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 743622 Cortex-A9
	  (r2p*) erratum. Under very rare conditions, a faulty
	  optimisation in the Cortex-A9 Store Buffer may lead to data
	  corruption. This workaround sets a specific bit in the diagnostic
	  register of the Cortex-A9 which disables the Store Buffer
	  optimisation, preventing the defect from occurring. This has no
	  visible impact on the overall performance or power consumption of the
	  processor.

config ARM_ERRATA_751472
	bool "ARM errata: Interrupted ICIALLUIS may prevent completion of broadcasted operation"
	depends on CPU_V7
	depends on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 751472 Cortex-A9 (prior
	  to r3p0) erratum. An interrupted ICIALLUIS operation may prevent the
	  completion of a following broadcasted operation if the second
	  operation is received by a CPU before the ICIALLUIS has completed,
	  potentially leading to corrupted entries in the cache or TLB.

config ARM_ERRATA_754322
	bool "ARM errata: possible faulty MMU translations following an ASID switch"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 754322 Cortex-A9 (r2p*,
	  r3p*) erratum. A speculative memory access may cause a page table walk
	  which starts prior to an ASID switch but completes afterwards. This
	  can populate the micro-TLB with a stale entry which may be hit with
	  the new ASID. This workaround places two dsb instructions in the mm
	  switching code so that no page table walks can cross the ASID switch.

config ARM_ERRATA_754327
	bool "ARM errata: no automatic Store Buffer drain"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 754327 Cortex-A9 (prior to
	  r2p0) erratum. The Store Buffer does not have any automatic draining
	  mechanism and therefore a livelock may occur if an external agent
	  continuously polls a memory location waiting to observe an update.
	  This workaround defines cpu_relax() as smp_mb(), preventing correctly
	  written polling loops from denying visibility of updates to memory.

config ARM_ERRATA_364296
	bool "ARM errata: Possible cache data corruption with hit-under-miss enabled"
	depends on CPU_V6
	help
	  This options enables the workaround for the 364296 ARM1136
	  r0p2 erratum (possible cache data corruption with
	  hit-under-miss enabled). It sets the undocumented bit 31 in
	  the auxiliary control register and the FI bit in the control
	  register, thus disabling hit-under-miss without putting the
	  processor into full low interrupt latency mode. ARM11MPCore
	  is not affected.

config ARM_ERRATA_764369
	bool "ARM errata: Data cache line maintenance operation by MVA may not succeed"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for erratum 764369
	  affecting Cortex-A9 MPCore with two or more processors (all
	  current revisions). Under certain timing circumstances, a data
	  cache line maintenance operation by MVA targeting an Inner
	  Shareable memory region may fail to proceed up to either the
	  Point of Coherency or to the Point of Unification of the
	  system. This workaround adds a DSB instruction before the
	  relevant cache maintenance functions and sets a specific bit
	  in the diagnostic control register of the SCU.

config ARM_ERRATA_775420
       bool "ARM errata: A data cache maintenance operation which aborts, might lead to deadlock"
       depends on CPU_V7
       help
	 This option enables the workaround for the 775420 Cortex-A9 (r2p2,
	 r2p6,r2p8,r2p10,r3p0) erratum. In case a date cache maintenance
	 operation aborts with MMU exception, it might cause the processor
	 to deadlock. This workaround puts DSB before executing ISB if
	 an abort may occur on cache maintenance.

config ARM_ERRATA_798181
	bool "ARM errata: TLBI/DSB failure on Cortex-A15"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	help
	  On Cortex-A15 (r0p0..r3p2) the TLBI*IS/DSB operations are not
	  adequately shooting down all use of the old entries. This
	  option enables the Linux kernel workaround for this erratum
	  which sends an IPI to the CPUs that are running the same ASID
	  as the one being invalidated.

config ARM_ERRATA_773022
	bool "ARM errata: incorrect instructions may be executed from loop buffer"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 773022 Cortex-A15
	  (up to r0p4) erratum. In certain rare sequences of code, the
	  loop buffer may deliver incorrect instructions. This
	  workaround disables the loop buffer to avoid the erratum.

	  This is a problem, because there's no guarantee the final

	  The symptom is that the kernel fails with an "unsupported
