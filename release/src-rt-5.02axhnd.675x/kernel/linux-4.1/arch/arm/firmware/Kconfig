	  Some devices (including most Tegra-based consumer devices on the
	  market) are booted with the Trusted Foundations secure monitor
	  active, requiring some core operations to be performed by the secure
	  monitor instead of the kernel.

	  This option allows the kernel to invoke the secure monitor whenever
	  required on devices using Trusted Foundations. See
	  arch/arm/include/asm/trusted_foundations.h or the
	  tlm,trusted-foundations device tree binding documentation for details
	  on how to use it.

	  Say n if you don't know what this is about.
