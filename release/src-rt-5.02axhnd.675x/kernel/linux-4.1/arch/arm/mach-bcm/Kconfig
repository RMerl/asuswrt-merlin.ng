	  This enables support for systems based on Broadcom IPROC architected SoCs.
	  The IPROC complex contains one or more ARM CPUs along with common
	  core periperals. Application specific SoCs are created by adding a
	  uArchitecture containing peripherals outside of the IPROC complex.
	  Currently supported SoCs are Cygnus.

config ARCH_BCM_CYGNUS
	bool "Broadcom Cygnus Support" if ARCH_MULTI_V7
	select ARCH_BCM_IPROC
	help
	  Enable support for the Cygnus family,
	  which includes the following variants:
	  BCM11300, BCM11320, BCM11350, BCM11360,
	  BCM58300, BCM58302, BCM58303, BCM58305.

config ARCH_BCM_5301X

	select ARCH_BCM_IPROC
	help
	  Support for Broadcom BCM470X and BCM5301X SoCs with ARM CPU cores.

	  This is a network SoC line mostly used in home routers and
	  wifi access points, it's internal name is Northstar.
	  This inclused the following SoC: BCM53010, BCM53011, BCM53012,
	  BCM53014, BCM53015, BCM53016, BCM53017, BCM53018, BCM4707,
	  BCM4708 and BCM4709.

	  Do not confuse this with the BCM4760 which is a totally
	  different SoC or with the older BCM47XX and BCM53XX based
	  network SoC using a MIPS CPU, they are supported by arch/mips/bcm47xx
