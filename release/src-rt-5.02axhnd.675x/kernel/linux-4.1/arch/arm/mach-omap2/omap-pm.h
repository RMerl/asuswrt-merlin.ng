 * Request that the maximum interrupt latency for the MPU to be no
 * greater than @t microseconds. "Interrupt latency" in this case is
 * defined as the elapsed time from the occurrence of a hardware or
 * timer interrupt to the time when the device driver's interrupt
 * service routine has been entered by the MPU.
 *
 * It is intended that underlying PM code will use this information to
 * determine what power state to put the MPU powerdomain into, and
 * possibly the CORE powerdomain as well, since interrupt handling
 * code currently runs from SDRAM.  Advanced PM or board*.c code may
 * also configure interrupt controller priorities, OCP bus priorities,
 * CPU speed(s), etc.
 *
 * This function will not affect device wakeup latency, e.g., time
 * elapsed from when a device driver enables a hardware device with
 * clk_enable(), to when the device is ready for register access or
 * other use.  To control this device wakeup latency, use
 * omap_pm_set_max_dev_wakeup_lat()
 *
 * Multiple calls to omap_pm_set_max_mpu_wakeup_lat() will replace the
 * previous t value.  To remove the latency target for the MPU, call
 * with t = -1.
 *
 * XXX This constraint will be deprecated soon in favor of the more
 * general omap_pm_set_max_dev_wakeup_lat()
 *
 * Returns -EINVAL for an invalid argument, -ERANGE if the constraint
 * is not satisfiable, or 0 upon success.

 * It is expected that the OMAP PM or bus code will use this

 * bus code will adjust the estimate based on its model of the bus, so
 * device driver authors should attempt to specify an accurate
 * quantity for their device use case, and let the PM or bus code
 * overestimate the numbers as necessary to handle request/response
 * latency, other competing users on the system, etc.  On OMAP2/3, if
 * a driver requests a minimum L4 interconnect speed constraint, the
 * code will also need to add an minimum L3 interconnect speed

 * driver must restore device context.   If the number of context losses
 * exceeds the maximum positive integer, the function will wrap to 0 and
 * continue counting.  Returns the number of context losses for this device,
