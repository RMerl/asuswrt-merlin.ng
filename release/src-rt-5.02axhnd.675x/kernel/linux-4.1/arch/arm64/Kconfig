	  erratum 826319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 4 ACE or
	  AXI master interface and an L2 cache.

	  If a Cortex-A53 uses an AMBA AXI4 ACE interface to other processors
	  and is unable to accept a certain write via this interface, it will
	  not progress on read data presented on the read data channel and the
	  system can deadlock.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  Under certain conditions this erratum can cause a clean line eviction
	  to occur at the same time as another transaction to the same address
	  on the AMBA 5 CHI interface, which can cause data corruption if the
	  interconnect reorders the two transactions.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  part, a load at EL0 from a virtual address that matches the bottom 32
	  bits of the virtual address used by a recent load at (AArch64) EL1
	  might return incorrect data.

	  The workaround is to write the contextidr_el1 register on exception
	  return to a 32-bit task.

	  NOTE: when accessing uncached shared regions, LDXR/STXR rely
