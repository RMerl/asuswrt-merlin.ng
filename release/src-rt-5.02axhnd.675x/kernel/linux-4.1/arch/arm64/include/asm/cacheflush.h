 *	MM Cache Management
 *	===================
 *
 *	The arch/arm64/mm/cache.S implements these methods.
 *
 *	Start addresses are inclusive and end addresses are exclusive; start
 *	addresses should be rounded down, end addresses up.
 *
 *	See Documentation/cachetlb.txt for more information. Please note that
 *	the implementation assumes non-aliasing VIPT D-cache and (aliasing)
 *	VIPT or ASID-tagged VIVT I-cache.
 *
 *	flush_cache_all()
 *
 *		Unconditionally clean and invalidate the entire cache.
 *
 *	flush_cache_mm(mm)
 *
 *		Clean and invalidate all user space cache entries
 *		before a change of page tables.
 *
 *	flush_icache_range(start, end)
 *
 *		Ensure coherency between the I-cache and the D-cache in the
 *		region described by start, end.
 *		- start  - virtual start address
 *		- end    - virtual end address
 *
 *	__flush_cache_user_range(start, end)
 *
 *		Ensure coherency between the I-cache and the D-cache in the
 *		region described by start, end.
 *		- start  - virtual start address
 *		- end    - virtual end address
 *
 *	__flush_dcache_area(kaddr, size)
 *
 *		Ensure that the data held in page is written back.
 *		- kaddr  - page address
 *		- size   - region size
