/*
 * In order to reduce the number of times the FPSIMD state is needlessly saved
 * and restored, we need to keep track of two things:
 * (a) for each task, we need to remember which CPU was the last one to have
 *     the task's FPSIMD state loaded into its FPSIMD registers;
 * (b) for each CPU, we need to remember which task's userland FPSIMD state has
 *     been loaded into its FPSIMD registers most recently, or whether it has
 *     been used to perform kernel mode NEON in the meantime.
 *
 * For (a), we add a 'cpu' field to struct fpsimd_state, which gets updated to
 * the id of the current CPU everytime the state is loaded onto a CPU. For (b),
 * we add the per-cpu variable 'fpsimd_last_state' (below), which contains the
 * address of the userland FPSIMD state of the task that was loaded onto the CPU
 * the most recently, or NULL if kernel mode NEON has been performed after that.
 *
 * With this in place, we no longer have to restore the next FPSIMD state right
 * when switching between tasks. Instead, we can defer this check to userland
 * resume, at which time we verify whether the CPU's fpsimd_last_state and the
 * task's fpsimd_state.cpu are still mutually in sync. If this is the case, we
 * can omit the FPSIMD restore.
 *
 * As an optimization, we use the thread_info flag TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE to
 * indicate whether or not the userland FPSIMD state of the current task is
 * present in the registers. The flag is set unless the FPSIMD registers of this
 * CPU currently contain the most recent userland FPSIMD state of the current
 * task.
 *
 * For a certain task, the sequence may look something like this:
 * - the task gets scheduled in; if both the task's fpsimd_state.cpu field
 *   contains the id of the current CPU, and the CPU's fpsimd_last_state per-cpu
 *   variable points to the task's fpsimd_state, the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag is
 *   cleared, otherwise it is set;
 *
 * - the task returns to userland; if TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set, the task's
 *   userland FPSIMD state is copied from memory to the registers, the task's
 *   fpsimd_state.cpu field is set to the id of the current CPU, the current
 *   CPU's fpsimd_last_state pointer is set to this task's fpsimd_state and the
 *   TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag is cleared;
 *
 * - the task executes an ordinary syscall; upon return to userland, the
 *   TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag will still be cleared, so no FPSIMD state is
 *   restored;
 *
 * - the task executes a syscall which executes some NEON instructions; this is
 *   preceded by a call to kernel_neon_begin(), which copies the task's FPSIMD
 *   register contents to memory, clears the fpsimd_last_state per-cpu variable
 *   and sets the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag;
 *
 * - the task gets preempted after kernel_neon_end() is called; as we have not
 *   returned from the 2nd syscall yet, TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is still set so
 *   whatever is in the FPSIMD registers is not saved to memory, but discarded.
