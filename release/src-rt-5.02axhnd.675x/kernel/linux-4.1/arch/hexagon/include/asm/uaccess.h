/*
 * access_ok: - Checks if a user space pointer is valid
 * @type: Type of access: %VERIFY_READ or %VERIFY_WRITE.  Note that
 *        %VERIFY_WRITE is a superset of %VERIFY_READ - if it is safe
 *        to write to a block, it is always safe to read from it.
 * @addr: User space pointer to start of block to check
 * @size: Size of block to check
 *
 * Context: User context only.  This function may sleep.
 *
 * Checks if a pointer to a block of memory in user space is valid.
 *
 * Returns true (nonzero) if the memory block *may* be valid, false (zero)
 * if it is definitely invalid.
 *
 * User address space in Hexagon, like x86, goes to 0xbfffffff, so the
 * simple MSB-based tests used by MIPS won't work.  Some further
 * optimization is probably possible here, but for now, keep it
 * reasonably simple and not *too* slow.  After all, we've got the
 * MMU for backup.
