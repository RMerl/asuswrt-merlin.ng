	  Say Y here to allow turning CPUs off and on. CPUs can be

	  Say N if you want to disable CPU hotplug.

config HIGHMEM
	bool "High Memory Support"
	help
	  The address space of Meta processors is only 4 Gigabytes large
	  and it has to accommodate user address space, kernel address
	  space as well as some memory mapped IO. That means that, if you
	  have a large amount of physical memory and/or IO, not all of the
	  memory can be "permanently mapped" by the kernel. The physical
	  memory that is not permanently mapped is called "high memory".

	  Depending on the selected kernel/user memory split, minimum
	  vmalloc space and actual amount of RAM, you may not need this
	  option which should result in a slightly faster kernel.

	  If unsure, say n.

	  This enables support for systems with more than one thread running

config METAG_SMP_WRITE_REORDERING
	bool
	help
	  This attempts to prevent cache-memory incoherence due to external
	  reordering of writes from different hardware threads when SMP is
	  enabled. It adds fences (system event 0) to smp_mb and smp_rmb in an
	  attempt to catch some of the cases, and also before writes to shared
	  memory in LOCK1 protected atomics and spinlocks.
	  This will not completely prevent cache incoherency on affected cores.

config METAG_LNKGET_AROUND_CACHE
	bool
	depends on METAG_META21
	help
	  This indicates that the LNKGET/LNKSET instructions go around the
	  cache, which requires some extra cache flushes when the memory needs
	  to be accessed by normal GET/SET instructions too.

	  This option disables interrupts to achieve atomicity. This mechanism
	  is not SMP-safe.

config METAG_ATOMICITY_LNKGET
	depends on METAG_META21
	bool "lnkget/lnkset"
	help
	  This option uses the LNKGET and LNKSET instructions to achieve
	  atomicity. LNKGET/LNKSET are load-link/store-conditional instructions.
	  Choose this option if your system requires low latency.

config METAG_ATOMICITY_LOCK1
	depends on SMP
	bool "lock1"
	help
	  This option uses the LOCK1 instruction for atomicity. This is mainly
	  provided as a debugging aid if the lnkget/lnkset atomicity primitive
	  isn't working properly.

config METAG_FPU

	help
	  This option allows processes to use FPU hardware available with this

	  and restored on context-switch.

	  If you plan on running programs which are compiled to use hard floats
	  say Y here.

	help
	  This option allows processes to use DSP hardware available

	  If you plan on running DSP programs say Y here.

config METAG_PERFCOUNTER_IRQS

	help
	  This option enables using interrupts to collect information from
	  Performance Counters. This option is supported in new META21
	  (starting from HTP265).

	  When disabled, Performance Counters information will be collected
	  based on Timer Interrupt.

config METAG_DA

	help
	  Say Y if you plan to use a DA debug adapter with Linux. The presence
	  of the DA will be detected automatically at boot, so it is safe to say
	  Y to this option even when booting without a DA.

	  This enables support for services provided by DA JTAG debug adapters,
	  such as:
	  - communication over DA channels (such as the console driver).
	  - use of the DA filesystem.
