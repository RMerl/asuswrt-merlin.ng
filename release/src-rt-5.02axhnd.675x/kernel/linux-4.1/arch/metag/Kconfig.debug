config 4KSTACKS
	bool "Use 4Kb for kernel stacks instead of 8Kb"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use a 4Kb stacksize for the
	  kernel stack attached to each process/thread. This facilitates
	  running more threads on a system and also reduces the pressure
	  on the VM subsystem for higher order allocations. This option
	  will also use IRQ stacks to compensate for the reduced stackspace.

config METAG_FUNCTION_TRACE
	bool "Output Meta real-time trace data for function entry/exit"
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use the Meta hardware trace
	  unit to output information about function entry and exit that
	  can be used by a debugger for profiling and call-graphs.

config METAG_POISON_CATCH_BUFFERS
	bool "Poison catch buffer contents on kernel entry"
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will write poison data to the
	  catch buffer registers on kernel entry. This will make any
	  problem with catch buffer handling much more apparent.
