	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.

	depends on MMU
	help
	  The address space of Microblaze processors is only 4 Gigabytes large
	  and it has to accommodate user address space, kernel address
	  space as well as some memory mapped IO. That means that, if you
	  have a large amount of physical memory and/or IO, not all of the
	  memory can be "permanently mapped" by the kernel. The physical
	  memory that is not permanently mapped is called "high memory".

	  This option allows you to set the maximum amount of memory which

	  access directly, without having to set up a kernel virtual mapping.
	  This can be useful in optimizing the layout of kernel virtual
	  memory.

	help
	  Select the kernel logical page size. Increasing the page size
	  will reduce software overhead at each page boundary, allow
	  hardware prefetch mechanisms to be more effective, and allow
	  larger dma transfers increasing IO efficiency and reducing
	  overhead. However the utilization of memory will increase.
	  For example, each cached file will using a multiple of the
	  page size to hold its contents and the difference between the
	  end of file and the end of page is wasted.

	  If unsure, choose 4K_PAGES.
