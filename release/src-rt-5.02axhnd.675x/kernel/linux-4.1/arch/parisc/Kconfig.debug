       depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
       help
         Mark the kernel read-only data as write-protected in the pagetables,
         in order to catch accidental (and incorrect) writes to such const
         data. This option may have a slight performance impact because a
         portion of the kernel code won't be covered by a TLB anymore.
         If in doubt, say "N".
