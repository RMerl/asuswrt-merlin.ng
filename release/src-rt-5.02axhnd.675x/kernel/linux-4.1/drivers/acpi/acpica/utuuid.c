 * UUID support functions.
 *
 * This table is used to convert an input UUID ascii string to a 16 byte
 * buffer and the reverse. The table maps a UUID buffer index 0-15 to
 * the index within the 36-byte UUID string where the associated 2-byte
 * hex value can be found.
 *
 * 36-byte UUID strings are of the form:
 *     aabbccdd-eeff-gghh-iijj-kkllmmnnoopp
 * Where aa-pp are one byte hex numbers, made up of two hex digits
 *
 * Note: This table is basically the inverse of the string-to-offset table
 * found in the ACPI spec in the description of the to_UUID macro.
