	---help---
	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments
	  between said processes.

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_32BIT
	bool
	depends on !64BIT && ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	default y
	---help---
	  The Binder API has been changed to support both 32 and 64bit
	  applications in a mixed environment.

	  Enable this to support an old 32-bit Android user-space (v4.4 and
	  earlier).

	  Note that enabling this will break newer Android user-space.
