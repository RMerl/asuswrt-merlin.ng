menuconfig BLK_DEV
	bool "Block devices"
	depends on BLOCK
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for various different block device
	  drivers. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled;
	  only do this if you know what you are doing.

config BLK_DEV_FD
	tristate "Normal floppy disk support"
	depends on ARCH_MAY_HAVE_PC_FDC
	---help---
	  If you want to use the floppy disk drive(s) of your PC under Linux,
	  say Y. Information about this driver, especially important for IBM
	  Thinkpad users, is contained in
	  <file:Documentation/blockdev/floppy.txt>.
	  That file also contains the location of the Floppy driver FAQ as
	  well as location of the fdutils package used to configure additional
	  parameters of the driver at run time.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called floppy.

	help
	  If you have a SWIM-3 (Super Woz Integrated Machine 3; from Apple)
	  floppy controller, say Y here. Most commonly found in PowerMacs.

config BLK_DEV_SWIM
	tristate "Support for SWIM Macintosh floppy"
	depends on M68K && MAC
	help
	  You should select this option if you want floppy support
	  and you don't have a II, IIfx, Q900, Q950 or AV series.

config AMIGA_Z2RAM
	tristate "Amiga Zorro II ramdisk support"
	depends on ZORRO
	help
	  This enables support for using Chip RAM and Zorro II RAM as a
	  ramdisk or as a swap partition. Say Y if you want to include this
	  driver in the kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called z2ram.

config GDROM
	tristate "SEGA Dreamcast GD-ROM drive"
	depends on SH_DREAMCAST
	help
	  A standard SEGA Dreamcast comes with a modified CD ROM drive called a
	  "GD-ROM" by SEGA to signify it is capable of reading special disks
	  with up to 1 GB of data. This drive will also read standard CD ROM
	  disks. Select this option to access any disks in your GD ROM drive.
	  Most users will want to say "Y" here.
	  You can also build this as a module which will be called gdrom.

config PARIDE
	tristate "Parallel port IDE device support"
	depends on PARPORT_PC
	---help---
	  There are many external CD-ROM and disk devices that connect through
	  your computer's parallel port. Most of them are actually IDE devices
	  using a parallel port IDE adapter. This option enables the PARIDE
	  subsystem which contains drivers for many of these external drives.
	  Read <file:Documentation/blockdev/paride.txt> for more information.

	  If you have said Y to the "Parallel-port support" configuration
	  option, you may share a single port between your printer and other
	  parallel port devices. Answer Y to build PARIDE support into your
	  kernel, or M if you would like to build it as a loadable module. If
	  your parallel port support is in a loadable module, you must build
	  PARIDE as a module. If you built PARIDE support into your kernel,
	  you may still build the individual protocol modules and high-level
	  drivers as loadable modules. If you build this support as a module,
	  it will be called paride.

	  To use the PARIDE support, you must say Y or M here and also to at
	  least one high-level driver (e.g. "Parallel port IDE disks",
	  "Parallel port ATAPI CD-ROMs", "Parallel port ATAPI disks" etc.) and
	  to at least one protocol driver (e.g. "ATEN EH-100 protocol",
	  "MicroSolutions backpack protocol", "DataStor Commuter protocol"
	  etc.).

	depends on PCI && VIRT_TO_BUS && 0
	help
	  This is the driver for Compaq Smart Array controllers.  Everyone
	  using these boards should say Y here.  See the file
	  <file:Documentation/blockdev/cpqarray.txt> for the current list of
	  boards supported by this driver, and for further information on the
	  use of this driver.

config BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA
	tristate "Compaq Smart Array 5xxx support"
	depends on PCI
	select CHECK_SIGNATURE
	help
	  This is the driver for Compaq Smart Array 5xxx controllers.
	  Everyone using these boards should say Y here.
	  See <file:Documentation/blockdev/cciss.txt> for the current list of
	  boards supported by this driver, and for further information
	  on the use of this driver.

config CISS_SCSI_TAPE
	bool "SCSI tape drive support for Smart Array 5xxx"
	depends on BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA && PROC_FS
	depends on SCSI=y || SCSI=BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA
	help
	  When enabled (Y), this option allows SCSI tape drives and SCSI medium
	  changers (tape robots) to be accessed via a Compaq 5xxx array 
	  controller.  (See <file:Documentation/blockdev/cciss.txt> for more details.)

	  "SCSI support" and "SCSI tape support" must also be enabled for this 
	  option to work.

	  When this option is disabled (N), the SCSI portion of the driver 
	  is not compiled.

config BLK_DEV_DAC960
	tristate "Mylex DAC960/DAC1100 PCI RAID Controller support"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  This driver adds support for the Mylex DAC960, AcceleRAID, and
	  eXtremeRAID PCI RAID controllers.  See the file
	  <file:Documentation/blockdev/README.DAC960> for further information
	  about this driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called DAC960.

config BLK_DEV_UMEM
	tristate "Micro Memory MM5415 Battery Backed RAM support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will include support for the MM5415 family of
	  battery backed (Non-volatile) RAM cards.
	  <http://www.umem.com/>

	  The cards appear as block devices that can be partitioned into
	  as many as 15 partitions.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called umem.

	  The umem driver has not yet been allocated a MAJOR number, so
	  one is chosen dynamically.

config BLK_DEV_UBD
	bool "Virtual block device"
	depends on UML
	---help---
          The User-Mode Linux port includes a driver called UBD which will let
          you access arbitrary files on the host computer as block devices.
          Unless you know that you do not need such virtual block devices say
          Y here.

config BLK_DEV_UBD_SYNC
	bool "Always do synchronous disk IO for UBD"
	depends on BLK_DEV_UBD
	---help---
	  Writes to the virtual block device are not immediately written to the
	  host's disk; this may cause problems if, for example, the User-Mode
	  Linux 'Virtual Machine' uses a journalling filesystem and the host
	  computer crashes.

          Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk
          immediately) is configurable on a per-UBD basis by using a special
          kernel command line option.  Alternatively, you can say Y here to
          turn on synchronous operation by default for all block devices.

          If you're running a journalling file system (like reiserfs, for
          example) in your virtual machine, you will want to say Y here.  If
          you care for the safety of the data in your virtual machine, Y is a
          wise choice too.  In all other cases (for example, if you're just
          playing around with User-Mode Linux) you can choose N.

config BLK_DEV_COW_COMMON
	bool
	default BLK_DEV_UBD

config BLK_DEV_LOOP
	tristate "Loopback device support"
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
	  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
	  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the
	  util-linux package, see
	  <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>.

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in
	  a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server.

	  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require
	  kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option
	  and a Device Mapper target (which is superior, as it supports all
	  file systems). If you want to use the cryptoloop, say Y to both
	  LOOP and CRYPTOLOOP, and make sure you have a recent (version 2.12
	  or later) version of util-linux. Additionally, be aware that
	  the cryptoloop is not safe for storing journaled filesystems.

	  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
	  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called loop.

	  Most users will answer N here.

config BLK_DEV_LOOP_MIN_COUNT
	int "Number of loop devices to pre-create at init time"
	depends on BLK_DEV_LOOP
	default 8
	help
	  Static number of loop devices to be unconditionally pre-created
	  at init time.

	  This default value can be overwritten on the kernel command
	  line or with module-parameter loop.max_loop.

	  The historic default is 8. If a late 2011 version of losetup(8)
	  is used, it can be set to 0, since needed loop devices can be
	  dynamically allocated with the /dev/loop-control interface.

config BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP
	tristate "Cryptoloop Support"
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_CBC
	depends on BLK_DEV_LOOP
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to use the ciphers that are 
	  provided by the CryptoAPI as loop transformation. This might be
	  used as hard disk encryption.

	  WARNING: This device is not safe for journaled file systems like
	  ext3 or Reiserfs. Please use the Device Mapper crypto module
	  instead, which can be configured to be on-disk compatible with the
	  cryptoloop device.

source "drivers/block/drbd/Kconfig"

config BLK_DEV_NBD
	tristate "Network block device support"
	depends on NET
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow your computer to be a client for network
	  block devices, i.e. it will be able to use block devices exported by
	  servers (mount file systems on them etc.). Communication between
	  client and server works over TCP/IP networking, but to the client
	  program this is hidden: it looks like a regular local file access to
	  a block device special file such as /dev/nd0.

	  Network block devices also allows you to run a block-device in
	  userland (making server and client physically the same computer,
	  communicating using the loopback network device).

	  Read <file:Documentation/blockdev/nbd.txt> for more information,
	  especially about where to find the server code, which runs in user
	  space and does not need special kernel support.

	  Note that this has nothing to do with the network file systems NFS
	  or Coda; you can say N here even if you intend to use NFS or Coda.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nbd.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_NVME
	tristate "NVM Express block device"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  The NVM Express driver is for solid state drives directly
	  connected to the PCI or PCI Express bus.  If you know you
	  don't have one of these, it is safe to answer N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nvme.

config BLK_DEV_SKD
	tristate "STEC S1120 Block Driver"
	depends on PCI
	depends on 64BIT
	---help---
	Saying Y or M here will enable support for the
	STEC, Inc. S1120 PCIe SSD.

	Use device /dev/skd$N amd /dev/skd$Np$M.

config BLK_DEV_OSD
	tristate "OSD object-as-blkdev support"
	depends on SCSI_OSD_ULD
	---help---
	  Saying Y or M here will allow the exporting of a single SCSI
	  OSD (object-based storage) object as a Linux block device.

	  For example, if you create a 2G object on an OSD device,
	  you can then use this module to present that 2G object as
	  a Linux block device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called osdblk.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_SX8
	tristate "Promise SATA SX8 support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  Saying Y or M here will enable support for the 
	  Promise SATA SX8 controllers.

	  Use devices /dev/sx8/$N and /dev/sx8/$Np$M.

config BLK_DEV_RAM
	tristate "RAM block device support"
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a portion of your RAM memory as
	  a block device, so that you can make file systems on it, read and
	  write to it and do all the other things that you can do with normal
	  block devices (such as hard drives). It is usually used to load and
	  store a copy of a minimal root file system off of a floppy into RAM
	  during the initial install of Linux.

	  Note that the kernel command line option "ramdisk=XX" is now obsolete.
	  For details, read <file:Documentation/blockdev/ramdisk.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called brd. An alias "rd" has been defined
	  for historical reasons.

	  Most normal users won't need the RAM disk functionality, and can
	  thus say N here.

config BLK_DEV_RAM_COUNT
	int "Default number of RAM disks"
	default "16"
	depends on BLK_DEV_RAM
	help
	  The default value is 16 RAM disks. Change this if you know what you
	  are doing. If you boot from a filesystem that needs to be extracted
	  in memory, you will need at least one RAM disk (e.g. root on cramfs).

config BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE
	int "Default RAM disk size (kbytes)"
	depends on BLK_DEV_RAM
	default "4096"
	help
	  The default value is 4096 kilobytes. Only change this if you know
	  what you are doing.

config BLK_DEV_RAM_DAX
	bool "Support Direct Access (DAX) to RAM block devices"
	depends on BLK_DEV_RAM && FS_DAX
	default n
	help
	  Support filesystems using DAX to access RAM block devices.  This
	  avoids double-buffering data in the page cache before copying it
	  to the block device.  Answering Y will slightly enlarge the kernel,
	  and will prevent RAM block device backing store memory from being
	  allocated from highmem (only a problem for highmem systems).

config BLK_DEV_PMEM
	tristate "Persistent memory block device support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a contiguous range of reserved
	  memory as one or more persistent block devices.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called 'pmem'.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CDROM_PKTCDVD
	tristate "Packet writing on CD/DVD media"
	depends on !UML
	help
	  If you have a CDROM/DVD drive that supports packet writing, say
	  Y to include support. It should work with any MMC/Mt Fuji
	  compliant ATAPI or SCSI drive, which is just about any newer
	  DVD/CD writer.

	  Currently only writing to CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVDRAM discs
	  is possible.
	  DVD-RW disks must be in restricted overwrite mode.

	  See the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/packet-writing.txt>
	  for further information on the use of this driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pktcdvd.

config CDROM_PKTCDVD_BUFFERS
	int "Free buffers for data gathering"
	depends on CDROM_PKTCDVD
	default "8"
	help
	  This controls the maximum number of active concurrent packets. More
	  concurrent packets can increase write performance, but also require
	  more memory. Each concurrent packet will require approximately 64Kb
	  of non-swappable kernel memory, memory which will be allocated when
	  a disc is opened for writing.

config CDROM_PKTCDVD_WCACHE
	bool "Enable write caching"
	depends on CDROM_PKTCDVD
	help
	  If enabled, write caching will be set for the CD-R/W device. For now
	  this option is dangerous unless the CD-RW media is known good, as we
	  don't do deferred write error handling yet.

config ATA_OVER_ETH
	tristate "ATA over Ethernet support"
	depends on NET
	help
	This driver provides Support for ATA over Ethernet block
	devices like the Coraid EtherDrive (R) Storage Blade.

config MG_DISK

	depends on XEN_BACKEND
	help
	  The block-device backend driver allows the kernel to export its

	  The backend driver attaches itself to a any block device specified
	  in the XenBus configuration. There are no limits to what the block
	  device as long as it has a major and minor.

	  If you are compiling a kernel to run in a Xen block backend driver
	  domain (often this is domain 0) you should say Y here. To
