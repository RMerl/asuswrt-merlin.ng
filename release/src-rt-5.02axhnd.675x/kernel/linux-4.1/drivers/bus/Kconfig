config ARM_CCI
	bool

config ARM_CCI400_COMMON
	bool
	select ARM_CCI

config ARM_CCI400_PMU
	bool "ARM CCI400 PMU support"
	default y
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	depends on HW_PERF_EVENTS
	select ARM_CCI400_COMMON
	help
	  Support for PMU events monitoring on the ARM CCI cache coherent
	  interconnect.

	  If unsure, say Y

config ARM_CCI400_PORT_CTRL
	bool
	depends on ARM && OF && CPU_V7
	select ARM_CCI400_COMMON
	help
	  Low level power management driver for CCI400 cache coherent
	  interconnect for ARM platforms.

config ARM_CCN
	bool "ARM CCN driver support"
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	depends on PERF_EVENTS
	help
	  PMU (perf) driver supporting the ARM CCN (Cache Coherent Network)
	  interconnect.

config BRCMSTB_GISB_ARB
	bool "Broadcom STB GISB bus arbiter"
	depends on ARM || MIPS
	help
	  Driver for the Broadcom Set Top Box System-on-a-chip internal bus
	  arbiter. This driver provides timeout and target abort error handling
	  and internal bus master decoding.

config IMX_WEIM
	bool "Freescale EIM DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  Driver for i.MX WEIM controller.
	  The WEIM(Wireless External Interface Module) works like a bus.
	  You can attach many different devices on it, such as NOR, onenand.

config MIPS_CDMM
	bool "MIPS Common Device Memory Map (CDMM) Driver"
	depends on CPU_MIPSR2
	help
	  Driver needed for the MIPS Common Device Memory Map bus in MIPS
	  cores. This bus is for per-CPU tightly coupled devices such as the
	  Fast Debug Channel (FDC).

	  For this to work, either your bootloader needs to enable the CDMM
	  region at an unused physical address on the boot CPU, or else your
	  platform code needs to implement mips_cdmm_phys_base() (see
	  asm/cdmm.h).

config MVEBU_MBUS
	bool
	depends on PLAT_ORION
	help
	  Driver needed for the MBus configuration on Marvell EBU SoCs
	  (Kirkwood, Dove, Orion5x, MV78XX0 and Armada 370/XP).

config OMAP_INTERCONNECT
	tristate "OMAP INTERCONNECT DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS

	help
	  Driver to enable OMAP interconnect error handling driver.

config OMAP_OCP2SCP
	tristate "OMAP OCP2SCP DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Driver to enable ocp2scp module which transforms ocp interface
	  protocol to scp protocol. In OMAP4, USB PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP and in OMAP5, both USB PHY and SATA PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP.

config SIMPLE_PM_BUS
	bool "Simple Power-Managed Bus Driver"
	depends on OF && PM
	depends on ARCH_SHMOBILE || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Driver for transparent busses that don't need a real driver, but
	  where the bus controller is part of a PM domain, or under the control
	  of a functional clock, and thus relies on runtime PM for managing
	  this PM domain and/or clock.
	  An example of such a bus controller is the Renesas Bus State
	  Controller (BSC, sometimes called "LBSC within Bus Bridge", or
	  "External Bus Interface") as found on several Renesas ARM SoCs.

config VEXPRESS_CONFIG
	bool "Versatile Express configuration bus"
	default y if ARCH_VEXPRESS
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	depends on OF
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Platform configuration infrastructure for the ARM Ltd.
	  Versatile Express.
