menuconfig TCG_TPM
	tristate "TPM Hardware Support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	select SECURITYFS
	---help---
	  If you have a TPM security chip in your system, which
	  implements the Trusted Computing Group's specification,
	  say Yes and it will be accessible from within Linux.  For
	  more information see <http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org>. 
	  An implementation of the Trusted Software Stack (TSS), the 
	  userspace enablement piece of the specification, can be 
	  obtained at: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/trousers>.  To 
	  compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the module 
	  will be called tpm. If unsure, say N.
	  Notes:
	  1) For more TPM drivers enable CONFIG_PNP, CONFIG_ACPI
	  and CONFIG_PNPACPI.
	  2) Without ACPI enabled, the BIOS event log won't be accessible,
	  which is required to validate the PCR 0-7 values.
