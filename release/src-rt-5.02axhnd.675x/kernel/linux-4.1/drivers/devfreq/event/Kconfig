	  The devfreq-event device provide the raw data and events which
	  indicate the current state of devfreq-event device. The provided
	  data from devfreq-event device is used to monitor the state of
	  device and determine the suitable size of resource to reduce the
	  wasted resource.

	  The devfreq-event device can support the various type of events
	  (e.g., raw data, utilization, latency, bandwidth). The events
	  may be used by devfreq governor and other subsystem.
