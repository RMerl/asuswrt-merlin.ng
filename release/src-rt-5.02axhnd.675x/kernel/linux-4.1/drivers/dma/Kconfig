	help
	  DMA engines can do asynchronous data transfers without
	  involving the host CPU.  Currently, this framework can be
	  used to offload memory copies in the network stack and
	  RAID operations in the MD driver.  This menu only presents
	  DMA Device drivers supported by the configured arch, it may
	  be empty in some cases.

        bool "DMA Engine debugging"
        depends on DMADEVICES != n
        help
          This is an option for use by developers; most people should
          say N here.  This enables DMA engine core and driver debugging.

config DMADEVICES_VDEBUG

        depends on DMADEVICES_DEBUG != n
        help
          This is an option for use by developers; most people should
