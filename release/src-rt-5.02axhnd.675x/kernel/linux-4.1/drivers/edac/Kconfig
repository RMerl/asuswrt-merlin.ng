	bool "EDAC (Error Detection And Correction) reporting"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on X86 || PPC || TILE || ARM || EDAC_SUPPORT
	help
	  EDAC is designed to report errors in the core system.
	  These are low-level errors that are reported in the CPU or
	  supporting chipset or other subsystems:
	  memory errors, cache errors, PCI errors, thermal throttling, etc..
	  If unsure, select 'Y'.

	  If this code is reporting problems on your system, please
	  see the EDAC project web pages for more information at:

	  <http://bluesmoke.sourceforge.net/>

	  and:

	  <http://buttersideup.com/edacwiki>

	  There is also a mailing list for the EDAC project, which can
	  be found via the sourceforge page.

config EDAC_LEGACY_SYSFS
	bool "EDAC legacy sysfs"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the compatibility sysfs nodes.
	  Use 'Y' if your edac utilities aren't ported to work with the newer
	  structures.

config EDAC_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging"
	help
	  This turns on debugging information for the entire EDAC subsystem.
	  You do so by inserting edac_module with "edac_debug_level=x." Valid
	  levels are 0-4 (from low to high) and by default it is set to 2.
	  Usually you should select 'N' here.

config EDAC_DECODE_MCE
	tristate "Decode MCEs in human-readable form (only on AMD for now)"
	depends on CPU_SUP_AMD && X86_MCE_AMD
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable this option if you want to decode Machine Check Exceptions
	  occurring on your machine in human-readable form.

	  You should definitely say Y here in case you want to decode MCEs
	  which occur really early upon boot, before the module infrastructure
	  has been initialized.

config EDAC_MCE_INJ
	tristate "Simple MCE injection interface"
	depends on EDAC_DECODE_MCE && DEBUG_FS
	default n
	help
	  This is a simple debugfs interface to inject MCEs and test different
	  aspects of the MCE handling code.

	  WARNING: Do not even assume this interface is staying stable!

config EDAC_MM_EDAC
	tristate "Main Memory EDAC (Error Detection And Correction) reporting"
	select RAS
	help
	  Some systems are able to detect and correct errors in main
	  memory.  EDAC can report statistics on memory error
	  detection and correction (EDAC - or commonly referred to ECC
	  errors).  EDAC will also try to decode where these errors
	  occurred so that a particular failing memory module can be
	  replaced.  If unsure, select 'Y'.

config EDAC_GHES
	bool "Output ACPI APEI/GHES BIOS detected errors via EDAC"
	depends on ACPI_APEI_GHES && (EDAC_MM_EDAC=y)
	default y
	help
	  Not all machines support hardware-driven error report. Some of those
	  provide a BIOS-driven error report mechanism via ACPI, using the
	  APEI/GHES driver. By enabling this option, the error reports provided
	  by GHES are sent to userspace via the EDAC API.

	  When this option is enabled, it will disable the hardware-driven
	  mechanisms, if a GHES BIOS is detected, entering into the
	  "Firmware First" mode.

	  It should be noticed that keeping both GHES and a hardware-driven
	  error mechanism won't work well, as BIOS will race with OS, while
	  reading the error registers. So, if you want to not use "Firmware
	  first" GHES error mechanism, you should disable GHES either at
	  compilation time or by passing "ghes.disable=1" Kernel parameter
	  at boot time.

	  In doubt, say 'Y'.

config EDAC_AMD64_ERROR_INJECTION
	bool "Sysfs HW Error injection facilities"
	depends on EDAC_AMD64
	help
	  Recent Opterons (Family 10h and later) provide for Memory Error
	  Injection into the ECC detection circuits. The amd64_edac module
	  allows the operator/user to inject Uncorrectable and Correctable
	  errors into DRAM.

	  When enabled, in each of the respective memory controller directories
	  (/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mcX), there are 3 input files:

	  - inject_section (0..3, 16-byte section of 64-byte cacheline),
	  - inject_word (0..8, 16-bit word of 16-byte section),
	  - inject_ecc_vector (hex ecc vector: select bits of inject word)

	  In addition, there are two control files, inject_read and inject_write,
	  which trigger the DRAM ECC Read and Write respectively.
