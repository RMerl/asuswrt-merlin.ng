/**
 * struct kernel_queue_ops
 *
 * @initialize: Initialize a kernel queue, including allocations of GART memory
 * needed for the queue.
 *
 * @uninitialize: Uninitialize a kernel queue and free all its memory usages.
 *
 * @acquire_packet_buffer: Returns a pointer to the location in the kernel
 * queue ring buffer where the calling function can write its packet. It is
 * Guaranteed that there is enough space for that packet. It also updates the
 * pending write pointer to that location so subsequent calls to
 * acquire_packet_buffer will get a correct write pointer
 *
 * @submit_packet: Update the write pointer and doorbell of a kernel queue.
 *
 * @sync_with_hw: Wait until the write pointer and the read pointer of a kernel
 * queue are equal, which means the CP has read all the submitted packets.
 *
 * @rollback_packet: This routine is called if we failed to build an acquired
 * packet for some reason. It just overwrites the pending wptr with the current
 * one
 *
