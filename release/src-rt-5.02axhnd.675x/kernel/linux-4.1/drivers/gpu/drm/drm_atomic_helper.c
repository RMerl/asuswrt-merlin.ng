/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * This helper library provides implementations of check and commit functions on
 * top of the CRTC modeset helper callbacks and the plane helper callbacks. It
 * also provides convenience implementations for the atomic state handling
 * callbacks for drivers which don't need to subclass the drm core structures to
 * add their own additional internal state.
 *
 * This library also provides default implementations for the check callback in
 * drm_atomic_helper_check and for the commit callback with
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit. But the individual stages and callbacks are expose
 * to allow drivers to mix and match and e.g. use the plane helpers only
 * together with a driver private modeset implementation.
 *
 * This library also provides implementations for all the legacy driver
 * interfaces on top of the atomic interface. See drm_atomic_helper_set_config,
 * drm_atomic_helper_disable_plane, drm_atomic_helper_disable_plane and the
 * various functions to implement set_property callbacks. New drivers must not
 * implement these functions themselves but must use the provided helpers.

/**
 * DOC: implementing async commit
 *
 * For now the atomic helpers don't support async commit directly. If there is
 * real need it could be added though, using the dma-buf fence infrastructure
 * for generic synchronization with outstanding rendering.
 *
 * For now drivers have to implement async commit themselves, with the following
 * sequence being the recommended one:
 *
 * 1. Run drm_atomic_helper_prepare_planes() first. This is the only function
 * which commit needs to call which can fail, so we want to run it first and
 * synchronously.
 *
 * 2. Synchronize with any outstanding asynchronous commit worker threads which
 * might be affected the new state update. This can be done by either cancelling
 * or flushing the work items, depending upon whether the driver can deal with
 * cancelled updates. Note that it is important to ensure that the framebuffer
 * cleanup is still done when cancelling.
 *
 * For sufficient parallelism it is recommended to have a work item per crtc
 * (for updates which don't touch global state) and a global one. Then we only
 * need to synchronize with the crtc work items for changed crtcs and the global
 * work item, which allows nice concurrent updates on disjoint sets of crtcs.
 *
 * 3. The software state is updated synchronously with
 * drm_atomic_helper_swap_state. Doing this under the protection of all modeset
 * locks means concurrent callers never see inconsistent state. And doing this
 * while it's guaranteed that no relevant async worker runs means that async
 * workers do not need grab any locks. Actually they must not grab locks, for
 * otherwise the work flushing will deadlock.
 *
 * 4. Schedule a work item to do all subsequent steps, using the split-out
 * commit helpers: a) pre-plane commit b) plane commit c) post-plane commit and
 * then cleaning up the framebuffers after the old framebuffer is no longer
 * being displayed.
