/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * This helper library has two parts. The first part has support to implement
 * primary plane support on top of the normal CRTC configuration interface.
 * Since the legacy ->set_config interface ties the primary plane together with
 * the CRTC state this does not allow userspace to disable the primary plane
 * itself.  To avoid too much duplicated code use
 * drm_plane_helper_check_update() which can be used to enforce the same
 * restrictions as primary planes had thus. The default primary plane only
 * expose XRBG8888 and ARGB8888 as valid pixel formats for the attached
 * framebuffer.
 *
 * Drivers are highly recommended to implement proper support for primary
 * planes, and newly merged drivers must not rely upon these transitional
 * helpers.
 *
 * The second part also implements transitional helpers which allow drivers to
 * gradually switch to the atomic helper infrastructure for plane updates. Once
 * that switch is complete drivers shouldn't use these any longer, instead using
 * the proper legacy implementations for update and disable plane hooks provided
 * by the atomic helpers.
 *
 * Again drivers are strongly urged to switch to the new interfaces.
 */

/*
 * This is the minimal list of formats that seem to be safe for modeset use
 * with all current DRM drivers.  Most hardware can actually support more
 * formats than this and drivers may specify a more accurate list when
 * creating the primary plane.  However drivers that still call
 * drm_plane_init() will use this minimal format list as the default.
