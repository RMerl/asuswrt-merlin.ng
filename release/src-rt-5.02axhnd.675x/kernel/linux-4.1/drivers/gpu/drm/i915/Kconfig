	  Choose this option if you have a system that has "Intel Graphics
	  Media Accelerator" or "HD Graphics" integrated graphics,
	  including 830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 945G, 965G,
	  G35, G41, G43, G45 chipsets and Celeron, Pentium, Core i3,
	  Core i5, Core i7 as well as Atom CPUs with integrated graphics.
	  If M is selected, the module will be called i915.  AGP support
	  is required for this driver to work. This driver is used by
	  the Intel driver in X.org 6.8 and XFree86 4.4 and above. It
	  replaces the older i830 module that supported a subset of the
	  hardware in older X.org releases.

	  Note that the older i810/i815 chipsets require the use of the
	  i810 driver instead, and the Atom z5xx series has an entirely
	  different implementation.

config DRM_I915_KMS

	  Choose this option if you have a need for the legacy fbdev
	  support. Note that this support also provide the linux console
	  support on top of the intel modesetting driver.

	  If in doubt, say "Y".

config DRM_I915_PRELIMINARY_HW_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable preliminary support for prerelease Intel hardware by default"
	depends on DRM_I915
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option if you have prerelease Intel hardware and want the
	  i915 driver to support it by default.  You can enable such support at
	  runtime with the module option i915.preliminary_hw_support=1; this
	  option changes the default for that module option.

	  If in doubt, say "N".
