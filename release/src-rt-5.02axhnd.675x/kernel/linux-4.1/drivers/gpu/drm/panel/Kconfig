	  a GPIO to be powered up. Optionally a backlight can be attached so
	  that it can be automatically turned off when the panel goes into a
	  low power state.

	  Say Y here if you want to enable support for Sharp LQ101R1SX01
	  TFT-LCD modules. The panel has a 2560x1600 resolution and uses
	  24 bit RGB per pixel. It provides a dual MIPI DSI interface to
	  the host and has a built-in LED backlight.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called panel-sharp-lq101r1sx01.
