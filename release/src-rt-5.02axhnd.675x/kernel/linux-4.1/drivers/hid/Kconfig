config HID
	tristate "HID bus support"
	depends on INPUT
	default y
	---help---
	  A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device that
	  interacts directly with and takes input from humans. The term "HID"
	  most commonly used to refer to the USB-HID specification, but other
	  devices (such as, but not strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are
	  designed using HID specification (this involves certain keyboards,
	  mice, tablets, etc). This option adds the HID bus to the kernel,
	  together with generic HID layer code. The HID devices are added and
	  removed from the HID bus by the transport-layer drivers, such as
	  usbhid (USB_HID) and hidp (BT_HIDP).

	  For docs and specs, see http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HID_BATTERY_STRENGTH
	bool "Battery level reporting for HID devices"
	depends on HID
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	default n
	---help---
	This option adds support of reporting battery strength (for HID devices
	that support this feature) through power_supply class so that userspace
	tools, such as upower, can display it.

config HIDRAW
	bool "/dev/hidraw raw HID device support"
	depends on HID
	---help---
	Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
	specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
	devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.

	This module supports these devices separately using a separate
	event interface on /dev/hidraw.

	There is also a /dev/hiddev configuration option in the USB HID
	configuration menu. In comparison to hiddev, this device does not process
	the hid events at all (no parsing, no lookups). This lets applications
	to work on raw hid events when they want to, and avoid using transport-specific
	userspace libhid/libusb libraries.

	If unsure, say Y.

config UHID
	tristate "User-space I/O driver support for HID subsystem"
	depends on HID
	default n
	---help---
	Say Y here if you want to provide HID I/O Drivers from user-space.
	This allows to write I/O drivers in user-space and feed the data from
	the device into the kernel. The kernel parses the HID reports, loads the
	corresponding HID Device Driver or provides input devices on top of your
	user-space device.

	This driver cannot be used to parse HID-reports in user-space and write
	special HID-drivers. You should use hidraw for that.
	Instead, this driver allows to write the transport-layer driver in
	user-space like USB-HID and Bluetooth-HID do in kernel-space.

	If unsure, say N.

	To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	module will be called uhid.

config HID_GENERIC
	tristate "Generic HID driver"
	depends on HID
	default HID
	---help---

	To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	will be called hid-generic.

	Support for Nintendo Wii and Wii U Bluetooth peripherals. Supported
	devices are the Wii Remote and its extension devices, but also devices
	based on the Wii Remote like the Wii U Pro Controller or the
	Wii Balance Board.

	Support for all official Nintendo extensions is available, however, 3rd
	party extensions might not be supported. Please report these devices to:
	  http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote/issues

	Other Nintendo Wii U peripherals that are IEEE 802.11 based (including
	the Wii U Gamepad) might be supported in the future. But currently
	support is limited to Bluetooth based devices.

	If unsure, say N.

	To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	module will be called hid-wiimote.

config HID_XINMO

	  Support for HID Sensor framework. This creates a MFD instance
	  for a sensor hub and identifies all the sensors connected to it.
	  Each sensor is registered as a MFD cell, so that sensor specific
	  processing can be done in a separate driver. Each sensor
	  drivers can use the service provided by this driver to register
	  for events and handle data streams. Each sensor driver can format
	  data and present to user mode using input or IIO interface.

config HID_SENSOR_CUSTOM_SENSOR
	tristate "HID Sensors hub custom sensor support"

	default n
	---help---
	  HID Sensor hub specification allows definition of some custom and
	  generic sensors. Unlike other HID sensors, they can't be exported
	  via Linux IIO because of custom fields. This is up to the manufacturer
	  to decide how to interpret these special sensor ids and process in
	  the user space. Currently some manufacturers are using these ids for
	  sensor calibration and debugging other sensors. Manufacturers
	  should't use these special custom sensor ids to export any of the
	  standard sensors.
	  Select this config option for custom/generic sensor support.
