config ADIS16080
	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16080/100 Yaw Rate Gyroscope with SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADIS16080, ADIS16100 Yaw
	  Rate Gyroscope with SPI.

config ADIS16130
	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16130 High Precision Angular Rate Sensor driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADIS16130 High Precision
	  Angular Rate Sensor driver.

	tristate "Analog devices ADIS16136 and similar gyroscopes driver"
	depends on SPI_MASTER
	select IIO_ADIS_LIB
	select IIO_ADIS_LIB_BUFFER if IIO_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the Analog Devices ADIS16133, ADIS16135,
	  ADIS16136 gyroscope devices.

config ADIS16260
	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16260 Digital Gyroscope Sensor SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	select IIO_ADIS_LIB
	select IIO_ADIS_LIB_BUFFER if IIO_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADIS16260 ADIS16265
	  ADIS16250 ADIS16255 and ADIS16251 programmable digital gyroscope sensors.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called adis16260.

config ADXRS450
	tristate "Analog Devices ADXRS450/3 Digital Output Gyroscope SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADXRS450 and ADXRS453
	  programmable digital output gyroscope.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called adxrs450.

config BMG160
	tristate "BOSCH BMG160 Gyro Sensor"
	depends on I2C
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Bosch BMG160 Tri-axis Gyro Sensor
	  driver. This driver also supports BMI055 gyroscope.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called bmg160.

config HID_SENSOR_GYRO_3D
	depends on HID_SENSOR_HUB
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	select HID_SENSOR_IIO_COMMON
	select HID_SENSOR_IIO_TRIGGER
	tristate "HID Gyroscope 3D"

	  Say yes here to build support for STMicroelectronics gyroscopes:
	  L3G4200D, LSM330DL, L3GD20, LSM330DLC, L3G4IS, LSM330.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, these modules
	  will be created:
	  - st_gyro (core functions for the driver [it is mandatory]);
	  - st_gyro_i2c (necessary for the I2C devices [optional*]);
	  - st_gyro_spi (necessary for the SPI devices [optional*]);

	  (*) one of these is necessary to do something.
