menuconfig LEDS_TRIGGERS
	bool "LED Trigger support"
	depends on LEDS_CLASS
	help
	  This option enables trigger support for the leds class.
	  These triggers allow kernel events to drive the LEDs and can
	  be configured via sysfs. If unsure, say Y.

if LEDS_TRIGGERS

config LEDS_TRIGGER_TIMER
	tristate "LED Timer Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a programmable timer
	  via sysfs. Some LED hardware can be programmed to start
	  blinking the LED without any further software interaction.
	  For more details read Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_ONESHOT
	tristate "LED One-shot Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to blink in one-shot pulses with parameters
	  controlled via sysfs.  It's useful to notify the user on
	  sporadic events, when there are no clear begin and end trap points,
	  or on dense events, where this blinks the LED at constant rate if
	  rearmed continuously.

	  It also shows how to use the led_blink_set_oneshot() function.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_IDE_DISK
	bool "LED IDE Disk Trigger"
	depends on IDE_GD_ATA
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by IDE disk activity.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_HEARTBEAT
	tristate "LED Heartbeat Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a CPU load average.
	  The flash frequency is a hyperbolic function of the 1-minute
	  load average.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_BACKLIGHT
	tristate "LED backlight Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled as a backlight device: they
	  turn off and on when the display is blanked and unblanked.

	  If unsure, say N.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_CPU
	bool "LED CPU Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by active CPUs. This shows
	  the active CPUs across an array of LEDs so you can see which
	  CPUs are active on the system at any given moment.

	  If unsure, say N.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_GPIO
	tristate "LED GPIO Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	depends on GPIOLIB
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by gpio events. It's good
	  when using gpios as switches and triggering the needed LEDs
	  from there. One use case is n810's keypad LEDs that could
	  be triggered by this trigger when user slides up to show
	  keypad.

	  If unsure, say N.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_DEFAULT_ON
	tristate "LED Default ON Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be initialised in the ON state.
	  If unsure, say Y.

comment "iptables trigger is under Netfilter config (LED target)"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS

config LEDS_TRIGGER_TRANSIENT
	tristate "LED Transient Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows one time activation of a transient state on
	  GPIO/PWM based hardware.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_CAMERA
	tristate "LED Camera Flash/Torch Trigger"
	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled as a camera flash/torch device.
	  This enables direct flash/torch on/off by the driver, kernel space.
	  If unsure, say Y.
