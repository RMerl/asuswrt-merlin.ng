 *
 *  PCC (Platform Communication Channel) is defined in the ACPI 5.0+
 *  specification. It is a mailbox like mechanism to allow clients
 *  such as CPPC (Collaborative Processor Performance Control), RAS
 *  (Reliability, Availability and Serviceability) and MPST (Memory
 *  Node Power State Table) to talk to the platform (e.g. BMC) through
 *  shared memory regions as defined in the PCC table entries. The PCC
 *  specification supports a Doorbell mechanism for the PCC clients
 *  to notify the platform about new data. This Doorbell information
 *  is also specified in each PCC table entry.
 *
 *  Typical high level flow of operation is:
 *
 *  PCC Reads:
 *  * Client tries to acquire a channel lock.
 *  * After it is acquired it writes READ cmd in communication region cmd
 *		address.
 *  * Client issues mbox_send_message() which rings the PCC doorbell
 *		for its PCC channel.
 *  * If command completes, then client has control over channel and
 *		it can proceed with its reads.
 *  * Client releases lock.
 *
 *  PCC Writes:
 *  * Client tries to acquire channel lock.
 *  * Client writes to its communication region after it acquires a
 *		channel lock.
 *  * Client writes WRITE cmd in communication region cmd address.
 *  * Client issues mbox_send_message() which rings the PCC doorbell
 *		for its PCC channel.
 *  * If command completes, then writes have succeded and it can release
 *		the channel lock.
 *
 *  There is a Nominal latency defined for each channel which indicates
 *  how long to wait until a command completes. If command is not complete
 *  the client needs to retry or assume failure.
 *
 *	For more details about PCC, please see the ACPI specification from
 *  http://www.uefi.org/ACPIv5.1 Section 14.
 *
 *  This file implements PCC as a Mailbox controller and allows for PCC
 *  clients to be implemented as its Mailbox Client Channels.
