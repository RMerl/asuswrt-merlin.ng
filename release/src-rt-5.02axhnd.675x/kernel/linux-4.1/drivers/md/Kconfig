config BLK_DEV_MD
	tristate "RAID support"
	---help---
	  This driver lets you combine several hard disk partitions into one
	  logical block device. This can be used to simply append one
	  partition to another one or to combine several redundant hard disks
	  into a RAID1/4/5 device so as to provide protection against hard
	  disk failures. This is called "Software RAID" since the combining of
	  the partitions is done by the kernel. "Hardware RAID" means that the
	  combining is done by a dedicated controller; if you have such a
	  controller, you do not need to say Y here.

	  More information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
	  Software RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also learn
	  where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MD_AUTODETECT
	bool "Autodetect RAID arrays during kernel boot"
	depends on BLK_DEV_MD=y
	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, then the kernel will try to autodetect raid
	  arrays as part of its boot process. 

	  If you don't use raid and say Y, this autodetection can cause 
	  a several-second delay in the boot time due to various
	  synchronisation steps that are part of this step.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MD_LINEAR
	tristate "Linear (append) mode"
	depends on BLK_DEV_MD
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, then your multiple devices driver will be able to
	  use the so-called linear mode, i.e. it will combine the hard disk
	  partitions by simply appending one to the other.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called linear.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MD_RAID0
	tristate "RAID-0 (striping) mode"
	depends on BLK_DEV_MD
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, then your multiple devices driver will be able to
	  use the so-called raid0 mode, i.e. it will combine the hard disk
	  partitions into one logical device in such a fashion as to fill them
	  up evenly, one chunk here and one chunk there. This will increase
	  the throughput rate if the partitions reside on distinct disks.

	  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
	  Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from

config MD_RAID1
	tristate "RAID-1 (mirroring) mode"
	depends on BLK_DEV_MD
	---help---
	  A RAID-1 set consists of several disk drives which are exact copies
	  of each other.  In the event of a mirror failure, the RAID driver
	  will continue to use the operational mirrors in the set, providing
	  an error free MD (multiple device) to the higher levels of the
	  kernel.  In a set with N drives, the available space is the capacity
	  of a single drive, and the set protects against a failure of (N - 1)
	  drives.

config MD_RAID10
	tristate "RAID-10 (mirrored striping) mode"
	depends on BLK_DEV_MD
	---help---
	  RAID-10 provides a combination of striping (RAID-0) and
	  mirroring (RAID-1) with easier configuration and more flexible
	  layout.
	  Unlike RAID-0, but like RAID-1, RAID-10 requires all devices to
	  be the same size (or at least, only as much as the smallest device
	  will be used).
	  RAID-10 provides a variety of layouts that provide different levels
	  of redundancy and performance.

	  RAID-10 requires mdadm-1.7.0 or later, available at:

	  ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  A RAID-5 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive provides
	  the capacity of C * (N - 1) MB, and protects against a failure
	  of a single drive. For a given sector (row) number, (N - 1) drives
	  contain data sectors, and one drive contains the parity protection.
	  For a RAID-4 set, the parity blocks are present on a single drive,
	  while a RAID-5 set distributes the parity across the drives in one
	  of the available parity distribution methods.

	  A RAID-6 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive
	  provides the capacity of C * (N - 2) MB, and protects
	  against a failure of any two drives. For a given sector
	  (row) number, (N - 2) drives contain data sectors, and two
	  drives contains two independent redundancy syndromes.  Like
	  RAID-5, RAID-6 distributes the syndromes across the drives
	  in one of the available parity distribution methods.

	  Device-mapper is a low level volume manager.  It works by allowing

       ---help---
         dm-cache attempts to improve performance of a block device by
         moving frequently used data to a smaller, higher performance
         device.  Different 'policy' plugins can be used to change the
         algorithms used to select which blocks are promoted, demoted,
