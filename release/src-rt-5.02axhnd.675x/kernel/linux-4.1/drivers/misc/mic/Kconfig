comment "Intel MIC Bus Driver"

config INTEL_MIC_BUS

	depends on 64BIT && PCI && X86 && X86_DEV_DMA_OPS
	help
	  This option is selected by any driver which registers a
	  device or driver on the MIC Bus, such as CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_HOST,
	  CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_CARD, CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_X100_DMA etc.

	  If you are building a host/card kernel with an Intel MIC device
	  then say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	  More information about the Intel MIC family as well as the Linux
	  OS and tools for MIC to use with this driver are available from
	  <http://software.intel.com/en-us/mic-developer>.

comment "Intel MIC Host Driver"

config INTEL_MIC_HOST
	tristate "Intel MIC Host Driver"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI && X86 && INTEL_MIC_BUS
	select VHOST_RING
	help
	  This enables Host Driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor devices that
	  run a 64 bit Linux OS. The driver manages card OS state and
	  enables communication between host and card. Intel MIC X100
	  devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

comment "Intel MIC Card Driver"

config INTEL_MIC_CARD
	tristate "Intel MIC Card Driver"
	depends on 64BIT && X86 && INTEL_MIC_BUS
	select VIRTIO
	help
	  This enables card driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) device family. The card driver communicates shutdown/
	  crash events to the host and allows registration/configuration of
	  virtio devices. Intel MIC X100 devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a card kernel for an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.
