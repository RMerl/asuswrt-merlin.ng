config MTD_BRCMNAND
	tristate "Broadcom NAND controller support"
	depends on BCM_KF_MTD_BCMNAND
	select BRCMNAND_MTD_EXTENSION
	default n
	help
	  Say Y to enable the onchip NAND controller.

config BRCMNAND_MTD_EXTENSION
	bool "Enable Broadcom NAND controller extension"
	depends on BCM_KF_MTD_BCMNAND
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	default y
	help
	  Say Y to enable Broadcom NAND extension in order to support
	  27Byte Spare Area and 8KB page NAND flashes.

config MTD_BRCMNAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify Broadcom NAND page writes"
	default n
	depends on BCM_KF_MTD_BCMNAND
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  Broadcom NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentally due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_BRCMNAND_CORRECTABLE_ERR_HANDLING
	bool "Refresh a block on a one bit correctable ECC error"
	default n
	depends on BCM_KF_MTD_BCMNAND
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	help
	  If there is a 1-bit correctable error detected during NAND flash
	  read, the Broadcom NAND flash driver can refresh the corresponding
	  NAND flash block.  Refreshing implies a sequence of
	  read->erase->write. Refreshing the block drastically reduces the
	  probability of occurance of a similar (correctable) error.

	  Default is N because this is normally handled by UBI.

config MTD_BRCMNAND_EDU
	bool "Enable Broadcom NAND DMA (EDU)"
	default y
	select MTD_BRCMNAND_USE_ISR
	select MTD_BRCMNAND_ISR_QUEUE
	depends on BCM_KF_MTD_BCMNAND
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND && BRCM_HAS_EDU
	help
	  Say Y to enable the EBI DMA unit for NAND flash transfers.
	  Say N to use PIO transfers.

config BRCMNAND_MAJOR_VERS
	int "Broadcom NAND Major Version"
    default 2
	depends on BCM_KF_MTD_BCMNAND
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	help
      NAND controller major version.

config BRCMNAND_MINOR_VERS
	int "Broadcom NAND Minor Version"
    default 1
	depends on BCM_KF_MTD_BCMNAND
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	help
      NAND controller minor version.
