	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.
	  Make sure you know the name of your card. Read the Ethernet-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the remaining Blackfin card questions. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

	---help---
	  This is the driver for Blackfin on-chip mac device. Say Y if you want
	  it compiled into the kernel. This driver is also available as a
	  module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
	  kernel whenever you want). The module will be called bfin_mac.

config BFIN_MAC_USE_L1
	bool "Use L1 memory for rx/tx packets"
	depends on BFIN_MAC && (BF527 || BF537)
	default y
	---help---
	  To get maximum network performance, you should use L1 memory as rx/tx
	  buffers. Say N here if you want to reserve L1 memory for other uses.

config BFIN_TX_DESC_NUM
	int "Number of transmit buffer packets"
	depends on BFIN_MAC
	range 6 10 if BFIN_MAC_USE_L1
	range 10 100
	default "10"
	---help---
	  Set the number of buffer packets used in driver.

config BFIN_RX_DESC_NUM
	int "Number of receive buffer packets"
	depends on BFIN_MAC
	range 20 64
	default "20"
	---help---
	  Set the number of buffer packets used in driver.

config BFIN_MAC_USE_HWSTAMP
	bool "Use IEEE 1588 hwstamp"
	depends on BFIN_MAC && BF518
	select PTP_1588_CLOCK
	default y
	---help---
	  To support the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP), select y here
