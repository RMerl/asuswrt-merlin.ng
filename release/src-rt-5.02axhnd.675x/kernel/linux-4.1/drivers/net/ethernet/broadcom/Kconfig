config NET_VENDOR_BROADCOM
	bool "Broadcom devices"
	default y
	depends on (SSB_POSSIBLE && HAS_DMA) || PCI || BCM63XX || \
		   SIBYTE_SB1xxx_SOC
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) chipset belonging to this class,
	  say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect
	  the kernel: saying N will just case the configurator to skip all
	  the questions regarding AMD chipsets. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific chipset/driver in the following questions.
