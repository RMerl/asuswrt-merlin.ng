# Digital Equipment Inc network device configuration

config NET_VENDOR_DEC
	bool "Digital Equipment devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI || EISA || CARDBUS
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about DEC cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_DEC
source "drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/Kconfig"
endif # NET_VENDOR_DEC
