# HP network device configuration

config NET_VENDOR_HP
	bool "HP devices"
	default y
	depends on ISA || EISA || PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about HP cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_HP

config HP100
	tristate "HP 10/100VG PCLAN (ISA, EISA, PCI) support"
	depends on (ISA || EISA || PCI)
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called hp100.
