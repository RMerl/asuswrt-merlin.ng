# Mellanox driver configuration

config NET_VENDOR_MELLANOX
	bool "Mellanox devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Mellanox cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_MELLANOX

source "drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx4/Kconfig"
source "drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/Kconfig"

endif # NET_VENDOR_MELLANOX
