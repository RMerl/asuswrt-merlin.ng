config NET_VENDOR_MICROCHIP
	bool "Microchip devices"
	default y
	depends on SPI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Microchip cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_MICROCHIP

config ENC28J60
	tristate "ENC28J60 support"
	depends on SPI
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  Support for the Microchip EN28J60 ethernet chip.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be
	  called enc28j60.

config ENC28J60_WRITEVERIFY
	bool "Enable write verify"
	depends on ENC28J60
	---help---
	  Enable the verify after the buffer write useful for debugging purpose.
	  If unsure, say N.
