# Nuvoton network device configuration
#

config NET_VENDOR_NUVOTON
	bool "Nuvoton devices"
	default y
	depends on ARM && ARCH_W90X900
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Nuvoton cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_NUVOTON

config W90P910_ETH
	tristate "Nuvoton w90p910 Ethernet support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_W90X900
	select PHYLIB
	select MII
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use built-in Ethernet ports
	  on w90p910 processor.
