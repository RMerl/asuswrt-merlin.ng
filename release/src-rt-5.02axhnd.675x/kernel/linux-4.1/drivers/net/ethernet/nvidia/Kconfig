# NVIDIA network device configuration

config NET_VENDOR_NVIDIA
	bool "NVIDIA devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about NVIDIA cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_NVIDIA

config FORCEDETH
	tristate "nForce Ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) controller of this type, say Y and
	  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called forcedeth.
