# OKI Semiconductor device configuration

config NET_VENDOR_OKI
	bool "OKI Semiconductor devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about OKI Semiconductor cards. If you say Y, you will
	  be asked for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_OKI
