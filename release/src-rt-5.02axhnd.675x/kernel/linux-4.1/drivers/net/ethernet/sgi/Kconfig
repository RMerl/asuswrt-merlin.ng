config NET_VENDOR_SGI
	bool "SGI devices"
	default y
	depends on (PCI && SGI_IP27) || SGI_IP32
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about SGI devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_SGI

config SGI_IOC3_ETH
	bool "SGI IOC3 Ethernet"
	depends on PCI && SGI_IP27
	select CRC32
	select MII
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	tristate "SGI O2 MACE Fast Ethernet support"
