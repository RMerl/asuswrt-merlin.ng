config NET_VENDOR_TI
	bool "Texas Instruments (TI) devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI || EISA || AR7 || ARCH_DAVINCI || ARCH_OMAP2PLUS || ARCH_KEYSTONE
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about TI devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.
