	bool "Tundra devices"

	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Tundra cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	tristate "Tundra TSI108 gigabit Ethernet support"
	depends on TSI108_BRIDGE
	---help---
	  This driver supports Tundra TSI108 gigabit Ethernet ports.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called tsi108_eth.
