	  Say Y here to get to see options for IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate
	  Wireless Personal Area Network device drivers. This option alone
	  does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and

	  Say Y here to enable the fake driver that can emulate a net
	  of several interconnected radio devices.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. To do so say M here.
	  The module will be called 'fakelb'.
