 *
 * This implements an ethernet device for the i2400m.
 *
 * We fake being an ethernet device to simplify the support from user
 * space and from the other side. The world is (sadly) configured to
 * take in only Ethernet devices...
 *
 * Because of this, when using firmwares <= v1.3, there is an
 * copy-each-rxed-packet overhead on the RX path. Each IP packet has
 * to be reallocated to add an ethernet header (as there is no space
 * in what we get from the device). This is a known drawback and
 * firmwares >= 1.4 add header space that can be used to insert the
 * ethernet header without having to reallocate and copy.
 *
 * TX error handling is tricky; because we have to FIFO/queue the
 * buffers for transmission (as the hardware likes it aggregated), we
 * just give the skb to the TX subsystem and by the time it is
 * transmitted, we have long forgotten about it. So we just don't care
 * too much about it.
 *
 * Note that when the device is in idle mode with the basestation, we
 * need to negotiate coming back up online. That involves negotiation
 * and possible user space interaction. Thus, we defer to a workqueue
 * to do all that. By default, we only queue a single packet and drop
 * the rest, as potentially the time to go back from idle to normal is
 * long.
