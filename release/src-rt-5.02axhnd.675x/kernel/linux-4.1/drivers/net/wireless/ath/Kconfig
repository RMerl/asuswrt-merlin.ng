	  This will enable the support for the Atheros wireless drivers.
	  ath5k, ath9k, ath9k_htc and ar9170 drivers share some common code, this option
	  enables the common ath.ko module which shares common helpers.

config ATH_DEBUG
	bool "Atheros wireless debugging"
	---help---
	  Say Y, if you want to debug atheros wireless drivers.
	  Right now only ath9k makes use of this.
