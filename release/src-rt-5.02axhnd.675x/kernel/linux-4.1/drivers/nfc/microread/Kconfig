config NFC_MICROREAD
	tristate "Inside Secure microread NFC driver"
	depends on NFC_HCI
	select CRC_CCITT
	default n
	---help---
	  This module contains the main code for Inside Secure microread
	  NFC chipsets. It implements the chipset HCI logic and hooks into
	  the NFC kernel APIs. Physical layers will register against it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called microread.
	  Say N if unsure.

config NFC_MICROREAD_I2C
	tristate "NFC Microread i2c support"
	depends on NFC_MICROREAD && I2C && NFC_SHDLC
	---help---
	  This module adds support for the i2c interface of adapters using
	  Inside microread chipsets.  Select this if your platform is using
	  the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called microread_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.

config NFC_MICROREAD_MEI
	tristate "NFC Microread MEI support"
	depends on NFC_MICROREAD && NFC_MEI_PHY
	---help---
	  This module adds support for the mei interface of adapters using
	  Inside microread chipsets.  Select this if your microread chipset
	  is handled by Intel's Management Engine Interface on your platform.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called microread_mei.
	  Say N if unsure.
