	  NXP PN544 core driver.
	  This is a driver based on the HCI NFC kernel layers and
	  will thus not work with NXP libnfc library.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called pn544.
	  Say N if unsure.

	---help---
	  This module adds support for the NXP pn544 i2c interface.
	  Select this if your platform is using the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called pn544_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.
