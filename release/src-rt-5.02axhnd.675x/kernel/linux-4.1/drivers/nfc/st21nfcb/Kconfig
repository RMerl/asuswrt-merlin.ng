	---help---
	  STMicroelectronics ST21NFCB core driver. It implements the chipset
	  NCI logic and hooks into the NFC kernel APIs. Physical layers will
	  register against it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called st21nfcb.
	  Say N if unsure.

	depends on NFC_ST21NFCB && I2C
	---help---
	  This module adds support for the STMicroelectronics st21nfcb i2c interface.
	  Select this if your platform is using the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called st21nfcb_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.
