config PCI_DRA7XX
	bool "TI DRA7xx PCIe controller"
	select PCIE_DW
	depends on OF && HAS_IOMEM && TI_PIPE3
	help
	 Enables support for the PCIe controller in the DRA7xx SoC.  There
	 are two instances of PCIe controller in DRA7xx.  This controller can
	 act both as EP and RC.  This reuses the Designware core.

	depends on ARCH_KEYSTONE
	select PCIE_DW
	select PCIEPORTBUS
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable PCI controller support on Keystone
	  SoCs. The PCI controller on Keystone is based on Designware hardware
	  and therefore the driver re-uses the Designware core functions to
	  implement the driver.
