	select GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
	help
	  driver for memory mapped GPIO functionality on Intel Baytrail
	  platforms. Supports 3 banks with 102, 28 and 44 gpios.
	  Most pins are usually muxed to some other functionality by firmware,
	  so only a small amount is available for gpio use.

	  Requires ACPI device enumeration code to set up a platform device.

	select GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
	help
	  Cherryview/Braswell pinctrl driver provides an interface that
	  allows configuring of SoC pins and using them as GPIOs.
