	  For more information about this driver see
	  <file:Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt> and
	  <http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/> .

	  This driver was formerly known as ibm-acpi.

	  Extra functionality will be available if the rfkill (CONFIG_RFKILL)
	  and/or ALSA (CONFIG_SND) subsystems are available in the kernel.
	  Note that if you want ThinkPad-ACPI to be built-in instead of
	  modular, ALSA and rfkill will also have to be built-in.

	  If you have an IBM or Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, say Y or M here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_ALSA_SUPPORT
	bool "Console audio control ALSA interface"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	depends on SND
	depends on SND = y || THINKPAD_ACPI = SND
	default y
	---help---
	  Enables monitoring of the built-in console audio output control
	  (headphone and speakers), which is operated by the mute and (in
	  some ThinkPad models) volume hotkeys.

	  If this option is enabled, ThinkPad-ACPI will export an ALSA card
	  with a single read-only mixer control, which should be used for
	  on-screen-display feedback purposes by the Desktop Environment.

	  Optionally, the driver will also allow software control (the
	  ALSA mixer will be made read-write).  Please refer to the driver
	  documentation for details.

	  All IBM models have both volume and mute control.  Newer Lenovo
	  models only have mute control (the volume hotkeys are just normal
	  keys and volume control is done through the main HDA mixer).

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUGFACILITIES

	  otherwise.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug mode"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables extra debugging information, at the expense of a slightly
	  increase in driver size.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_UNSAFE_LEDS
	bool "Allow control of important LEDs (unsafe)"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Overriding LED state on ThinkPads can mask important
	  firmware alerts (like critical battery condition), or misled
	  the user into damaging the hardware (undocking or ejecting
	  the bay while buses are still active), etc.

	  LED control on the ThinkPad is write-only (with very few
	  exceptions on very ancient models), which makes it
	  impossible to know beforehand if important information will
	  be lost when one changes LED state.

	  Users that know what they are doing can enable this option
	  and the driver will allow control of every LED, including
	  the ones on the dock stations.

	  Never enable this option on a distribution kernel.

	  Say N here, unless you are building a kernel for your own
	  use, and need to control the important firmware LEDs.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_VIDEO
	bool "Video output control support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to provide an interface to control
	  the various video output ports.

	  This feature often won't work well, depending on ThinkPad model,
	  display state, video output devices in use, whether there is a X
	  server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of
	  Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control
	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid
	  bad interactions with X.org.

	  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the
	  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms
	  where it interacts badly with X.org.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here but do try to check if you could
	  be using X.org RandR instead.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL
	bool "Support NVRAM polling for hot keys"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.  The driver enables polling only if
	  it is strictly necessary to do so.

config SENSORS_HDAPS

	  This driver provides support for the IBM Hard Drive Active Protection
	  System (hdaps), which provides an accelerometer and other misc. data.
	  ThinkPads starting with the R50, T41, and X40 are supported.  The
	  accelerometer data is readable via sysfs.

	  This driver also provides an absolute input class device, allowing
	  the laptop to act as a pinball machine-esque joystick.

	  If your ThinkPad is not recognized by the driver, please update to latest
	  BIOS. This is especially the case for some R52 ThinkPads.

	help
	  This driver adds support for the ACPI-WMI (Windows Management
	  Instrumentation) mapper device (PNP0C14) found on some systems.

	  ACPI-WMI is a proprietary extension to ACPI to expose parts of the
	  ACPI firmware to userspace - this is done through various vendor
	  defined methods and data blocks in a PNP0C14 device, which are then
	  made available for userspace to call.

	  The implementation of this in Linux currently only exposes this to
	  other kernel space drivers.

	  This driver is a required dependency to build the firmware specific

	  This driver adds support for access to certain system settings
	  on "legacy free" Toshiba laptops.  These laptops can be recognized by
	  their lack of a BIOS setup menu and APM support.

	  On these machines, all system configuration is handled through the
	  ACPI.  This driver is required for access to controls not covered
	  by the general ACPI drivers, such as LCD brightness, video output,
	  etc.

	  This driver differs from the non-ACPI Toshiba laptop driver (located
	  under "Processor type and features") in several aspects.
	  Configuration is accessed by reading and writing text files in the
	  /proc tree instead of by program interface to /dev.  Furthermore, no
	  power management functions are exposed, as those are handled by the
	  general ACPI drivers.

config INTEL_IMR
	bool "Intel Isolated Memory Region support"
	default n
	depends on X86_INTEL_QUARK && IOSF_MBI
	---help---
	  This option provides a means to manipulate Isolated Memory Regions.
	  IMRs are a set of registers that define read and write access masks
	  to prohibit certain system agents from accessing memory with 1 KiB
	  granularity.

	  IMRs make it possible to control read/write access to an address
	  by hardware agents inside the SoC. Read and write masks can be
	  defined for:
		- eSRAM flush
		- Dirty CPU snoop (write only)
		- RMU access
		- PCI Virtual Channel 0/Virtual Channel 1
		- SMM mode
		- Non SMM mode

	  Quark contains a set of eight IMR registers and makes use of those
	  registers during its bootup process.

	  If you are running on a Galileo/Quark say Y here.

config IBM_RTL

	depends on X86 && PCI
	---help---
	 Enable support for IBM Premium Real Time Mode (PRTM).
	 This module will allow you the enter and exit PRTM in the BIOS via
	 sysfs on platforms that support this feature.  System in PRTM will
	 not receive CPU-generated SMIs for recoverable errors.  Use of this
	 feature without proper support may void your hardware warranty.

	 If the proper BIOS support is found the driver will load and create
	 /sys/devices/system/ibm_rtl/.  The "state" variable will indicate
	 whether or not the BIOS is in PRTM.
	 state = 0 (BIOS SMIs on)
	 state = 1 (BIOS SMIs off)

	  control is supported by the driver.

config INTEL_RST
        tristate "Intel Rapid Start Technology Driver"
	depends on ACPI
	---help---
	  This driver provides support for modifying paramaters on systems
	  equipped with Intel's Rapid Start Technology. When put in an ACPI
	  sleep state, these devices will wake after either a configured
	  timeout or when the system battery reaches a critical state,
	  automatically copying memory contents to disk. On resume, the
	  firmware will copy the memory contents back to RAM and resume the OS
	  as usual.

config INTEL_SMARTCONNECT
        tristate "Intel Smart Connect disabling driver"
	depends on ACPI
	---help---
	  Intel Smart Connect is a technology intended to permit devices to
	  update state by resuming for a short period of time at regular
	  intervals. If a user enables this functionality under Windows and
	  then reboots into Linux, the system may remain configured to resume
	  on suspend. In the absence of any userspace to support it, the system
	  will then remain awake until something triggers another suspend.

	  This driver checks to determine whether the device has Intel Smart
	  Connect enabled, and if so disables it.

config PVPANIC
	tristate "pvpanic device support"
	depends on ACPI
