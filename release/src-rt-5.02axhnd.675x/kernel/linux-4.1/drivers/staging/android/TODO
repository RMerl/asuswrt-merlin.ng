TODO:
	- checkpatch.pl cleanups
	- sparse fixes
	- rename files to be not so "generic"
	- make sure things build as modules properly
	- add proper arch dependencies as needed
	- audit userspace interfaces to make sure they are sane
	- kuid_t should never be exposed to user space as it is
          kernel internal type. Data structure for this kuid_t is:
          typedef struct {
          	uid_t val;
          } kuid_t;
	- This bug is introduced by Xiong Zhou in the patch bd471258f2e09
	- ("staging: android: logger: use kuid_t instead of uid_t")
