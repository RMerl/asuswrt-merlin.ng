TODO:
	- support for fractional multiplier
	- support for fractional divider (output 0 only)
	- support for set_rate() operations (may benefit from Stephen Boyd's
	  refactoring of the clk primitives: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/5/766)
	- review arithmetic
	  - overflow after multiplication?
	  - maximize accuracy before divisions
