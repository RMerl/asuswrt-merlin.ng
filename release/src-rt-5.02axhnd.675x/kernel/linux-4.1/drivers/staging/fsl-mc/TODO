* Add README file (with ASCII art) describing relationships between
  DPAA2 objects and how combine them to make a NIC, an LS2 switch, etc.
  Also, define all acronyms used.

* Decide if multiple root fsl-mc buses will be supported per Linux instance,
  and if so add support for this.

* Add at least one device driver for a DPAA2 object (child device of the
  fsl-mc bus).

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>,
