Description
-----------

The Maxim MAX517/518/519 is an 8-bit DAC on the I2C bus. The following table
shows the different feature sets of the variants MAX517, MAX518 and MAX519:

Feature                              MAX517 MAX518 MAX519
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
One output channel                   X
Two output channels                         X      X
Simultaneous output updates                 X      X
Supply voltage as reference                 X
Separate reference input             X
Reference input for each DAC                       X

Via the iio sysfs interface, there are three attributes available: out1_raw,
out2_raw and out12_raw. With out1_raw and out2_raw, the current output values
(0..255) of the DACs can be written to the device. out12_raw can be used to set
both output channel values simultaneously.

With MAX517, only out1_raw is available.

Via out1_scale (and where appropriate, out2_scale), the current scaling factor
in mV can be read.

When the operating system goes to a power down state, the Power Down function
of the chip is activated, reducing the supply current to 4uA.

On power-up, the device is in 0V-output state.
