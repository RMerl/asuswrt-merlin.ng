What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/range
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Hardware dependent ADC Full Scale Range used for some ambient
		light sensors in calculating lux.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/range_available
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Hardware dependent supported vales for ADC Full Scale Range.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/adc_resolution
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Hardware dependent ADC resolution of the ambient light sensor
		used in calculating the lux.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/adc_resolution_available
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Hardware dependent list of possible values supported for the
		adc_resolution of the given sensor.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_illuminance0[_input|_raw]
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This should return the calculated lux from the light sensor. If
		it comes back in SI units, it should also include _input else it
		should include _raw to signify it is not in SI units.

What:		/sys/.../device[n]/proximity_on_chip_ambient_infrared_suppression
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Hardware dependent mode for an ALS device to calculate the value
		in proximity mode. When this is enabled, then the device should
		use a infrared sensor reading to remove infrared noise from the
		proximity reading. If this is not enabled, the driver can still
		do this calculation manually by reading the infrared sensor
		value and doing the negation in sw.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_proximity[_input|_raw]
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This property is supported by proximity sensors and should be
		used to return the value of a reading by the sensor. If this
		value is returned in SI units, it should also include _input
		but if it is not, then it should include _raw.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/intensity_infrared[_input|_raw]
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This property is supported by sensors that have an infrared
		sensing mode. This value should be the output from a reading
		and if expressed in SI units, should include _input. If this
		value is not in SI units, then it should include _raw.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_illuminance0_target
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This property gets/sets the last known external
		lux measurement used in/for calibration.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_illuminance0_integration_time
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This property gets/sets the sensors ADC analog integration time.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_illuminance0_lux_table
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This property gets/sets the table of coefficients
		used in calculating illuminance in lux.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_intensity_clear[_input|_raw]
What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_intensity_red[_input|_raw]
What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_intensity_green[_input|_raw]
What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_intensity_blue[_input|_raw]
KernelVersion:	3.6.0
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This property is supported by sensors that have a RGBC
		sensing mode. This value should be the output from a reading
		and if expressed in SI units, should include _input. If this
		value is not in SI units (irradiance, uW/mm^2), then it should
		include _raw.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/device[n]/in_cct0[_input|_raw]
KernelVersion:	3.6.0
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This should return the correlated color temperature from the
		light sensor. If it comes back in SI units, it should also
		include _input else it should include _raw to signify it is not
		in SI units.
