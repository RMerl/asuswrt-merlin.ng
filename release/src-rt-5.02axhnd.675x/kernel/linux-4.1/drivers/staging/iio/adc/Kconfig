config AD7606
	tristate "Analog Devices AD7606 ADC driver"
	depends on GPIOLIB
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices:
	  ad7606, ad7606-6, ad7606-4 analog to digital converters (ADC).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad7606.

config AD7606_IFACE_PARALLEL
	tristate "parallel interface support"
	depends on AD7606
	help
	  Say yes here to include parallel interface support on the AD7606
	  ADC driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad7606_iface_parallel.

config AD7606_IFACE_SPI
	tristate "spi interface support"
	depends on AD7606
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to include parallel interface support on the AD7606
	  ADC driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad7606_iface_spi.

config AD7780
	tristate "Analog Devices AD7780 and similar ADCs driver"
	depends on SPI
	depends on GPIOLIB
	select AD_SIGMA_DELTA
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD7170, AD7171,
	  AD7780 and AD7781 SPI analog to digital converters (ADC).
	  If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad7780.

config AD7816
	tristate "Analog Devices AD7816/7/8 temperature sensor and ADC driver"
	depends on SPI
	depends on GPIOLIB
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD7816/7/8
	  temperature sensors and ADC.

config AD7192
	tristate "Analog Devices AD7190 AD7192 AD7195 ADC driver"
	depends on SPI
	select AD_SIGMA_DELTA
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD7190,
	  AD7192 or AD7195 SPI analog to digital converters (ADC).
	  If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad7192.

config AD7280
	tristate "Analog Devices AD7280A Lithium Ion Battery Monitoring System"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD7280A
	  Lithium Ion Battery Monitoring System.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad7280a

config LPC32XX_ADC
	tristate "NXP LPC32XX ADC"
	depends on ARCH_LPC32XX || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the integrated ADC inside the
	  LPC32XX SoC. Note that this feature uses the same hardware as the
	  touchscreen driver, so you should either select only one of the two
	  drivers (lpc32xx_adc or lpc32xx_ts) or, in the OpenFirmware case,
	  activate only one via device tree selection.  Provides direct access
	  via sysfs.

config MXS_LRADC
	tristate "Freescale i.MX23/i.MX28 LRADC"
	depends on (ARCH_MXS || COMPILE_TEST) && HAS_IOMEM
	depends on INPUT
	select STMP_DEVICE
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for i.MX23/i.MX28 LRADC convertor
	  built into these chips.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mxs-lradc.

config SPEAR_ADC
	tristate "ST SPEAr ADC"
	depends on PLAT_SPEAR || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the integrated ADC inside the
	  ST SPEAr SoC. Provides direct access via sysfs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called spear_adc.
