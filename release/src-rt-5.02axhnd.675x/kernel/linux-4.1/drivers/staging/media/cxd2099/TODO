For now, data is passed through '/dev/dvb/adapterX/sec0':
 - Encrypted data must be written to 'sec0'.
 - Decrypted data can be read from 'sec0'.
 - Setup the CAM using device 'ca0'.

While there's no proper fix for it, the driver should be kept in staging.

Patches should be submitted to: linux-media@vger.kernel.org.
