- All drivers should either be ported to ir-core, or dropped entirely
  (see drivers/media/IR/mceusb.c vs. lirc_mceusb.c in lirc cvs for an
  example of a previously completed port).

- lirc_bt829 uses registers on a Mach64 VT, which has a separate kernel
  framebuffer driver (atyfb) and userland X driver (mach64).  It can't
  simply be converted to a normal PCI driver, but ideally it should be
  coordinated with the other drivers.
