	depends on THERMAL
	depends on ARCH_HAS_BANDGAP
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Texas Instruments
	  OMAP4460+ on die bandgap temperature sensor support. The register
	  set is part of system control module.

	  This includes alert interrupts generation and also the TSHUT
	  support.

config TI_THERMAL
	bool "Texas Instruments SoCs thermal framework support"
	depends on TI_SOC_THERMAL
	depends on CPU_THERMAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you want to get support for generic thermal
	  framework for the Texas Instruments on die bandgap temperature sensor.

	  This includes trip points definitions, extrapolation rules and
	  CPU cooling device bindings.

config OMAP4_THERMAL
	bool "Texas Instruments OMAP4 thermal support"
	depends on TI_SOC_THERMAL
	depends on ARCH_OMAP4
	help
	  If you say yes here you get thermal support for the Texas Instruments
	  OMAP4 SoC family. The current chip supported are:
	   - OMAP4430
	   - OMAP4460
	   - OMAP4470

	  This includes alert interrupts generation and also the TSHUT
	  support.
