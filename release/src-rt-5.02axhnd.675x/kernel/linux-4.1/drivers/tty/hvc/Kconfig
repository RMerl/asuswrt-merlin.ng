	  Partitionable IBM Power5 ppc64 machines allow hosting of

	  another Linux partition.  This driver allows console data
	  from Linux partitions to be accessed through TTY device
	  interfaces in the device tree of a Linux partition running
	  this driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called hvcs.  Additionally, this module
	  will depend on arch specific APIs exported from hvcserver.ko
	  which will also be compiled when this driver is built as a
	  module.
