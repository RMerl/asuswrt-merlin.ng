menuconfig WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  on-line as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt> in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

if WATCHDOG

config WATCHDOG_CORE
	bool "WatchDog Timer Driver Core"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use the new watchdog timer driver core.
	  This driver provides a framework for all watchdog timer drivers
	  and gives them the /dev/watchdog interface (and later also the
	  sysfs interface).

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

	  IBM s/390 and zSeries machines running under z/VM 5.1 or later
	  provide a virtual watchdog timer to their guest that cause a
	  user define Control Program command to be executed after a
	  timeout.
	  LPAR provides a very similar interface. This driver handles
	  both.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called diag288_wdt.

# SUPERH (sh + sh64) Architecture

config SH_WDT
	tristate "SuperH Watchdog"
	depends on SUPERH && (CPU_SH3 || CPU_SH4)
	select WATCHDOG_CORE
	help
	  This driver adds watchdog support for the integrated watchdog in the
	  SuperH processors. If you have one of these processors and wish
	  to have watchdog support enabled, say Y, otherwise say N.

	  As a side note, saying Y here will automatically boost HZ to 1000
	  so that the timer has a chance to clear the overflow counter. On
	  slower systems (such as the SH-2 and SH-3) this will likely yield
	  some performance issues. As such, the WDT should be avoided here
	  unless it is absolutely necessary.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called shwdt.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpwatchdog.

	  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
	  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with hardware watchdog,
	  you should say N to this option.

config WATCHDOG_RIO
	tristate "RIO Hardware Watchdog support"
	depends on SPARC64 && PCI
	help
	  Say Y here to support the hardware watchdog capability on Sun RIO
	  machines.  The watchdog timeout period is normally one minute but
	  can be changed with a boot-time parameter.

config PCWATCHDOG

	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the Berkshire Products ISA-PC Watchdog card.
	  This card simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
	  and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
	  time. This driver is like the WDT501 driver but for different
	  hardware. Please read <file:Documentation/watchdog/pcwd-watchdog.txt>. The PC
	  watchdog cards can be ordered from <http://www.berkprod.com/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pcwd.

	  Most people will say N.

config MIXCOMWD

	  This is a driver for the Mixcom hardware watchdog cards.  This

	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have a WDT500P or WDT501P watchdog board, say Y here,
	  otherwise N. It is not possible to probe for this board, which means
	  that you have to inform the kernel about the IO port and IRQ that
	  is needed (you can do this via the io and irq parameters)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  This card simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
	  and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
	  time. The card can also monitor the internal temperature of the PC.

	  If you have a PCI-WDT500/501 watchdog board, say Y here, otherwise N.

	  If you have a PCI-WDT501 watchdog board then you can enable the
	  temperature sensor by setting the type parameter to 501.

	  If you want to enable the Fan Tachometer on the PCI-WDT501, then you
	  can do this via the tachometer parameter. Only do this if you have a
