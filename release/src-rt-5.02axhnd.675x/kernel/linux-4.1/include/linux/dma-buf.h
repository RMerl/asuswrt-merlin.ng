/**
 * struct dma_buf_ops - operations possible on struct dma_buf
 * @attach: [optional] allows different devices to 'attach' themselves to the
 *	    given buffer. It might return -EBUSY to signal that backing storage
 *	    is already allocated and incompatible with the requirements
 *	    of requesting device.
 * @detach: [optional] detach a given device from this buffer.
 * @map_dma_buf: returns list of scatter pages allocated, increases usecount
 *		 of the buffer. Requires atleast one attach to be called
 *		 before. Returned sg list should already be mapped into
 *		 _device_ address space. This call may sleep. May also return
 *		 -EINTR. Should return -EINVAL if attach hasn't been called yet.
 * @unmap_dma_buf: decreases usecount of buffer, might deallocate scatter
 *		   pages.
 * @release: release this buffer; to be called after the last dma_buf_put.
 * @begin_cpu_access: [optional] called before cpu access to invalidate cpu
 * 		      caches and allocate backing storage (if not yet done)
 * 		      respectively pin the objet into memory.
 * @end_cpu_access: [optional] called after cpu access to flush caches.
 * @kmap_atomic: maps a page from the buffer into kernel address
 * 		 space, users may not block until the subsequent unmap call.
 * 		 This callback must not sleep.
 * @kunmap_atomic: [optional] unmaps a atomically mapped page from the buffer.
 * 		   This Callback must not sleep.
 * @kmap: maps a page from the buffer into kernel address space.
 * @kunmap: [optional] unmaps a page from the buffer.
 * @mmap: used to expose the backing storage to userspace. Note that the
 * 	  mapping needs to be coherent - if the exporter doesn't directly
 * 	  support this, it needs to fake coherency by shooting down any ptes
 * 	  when transitioning away from the cpu domain.
 * @vmap: [optional] creates a virtual mapping for the buffer into kernel
 *	  address space. Same restrictions as for vmap and friends apply.
 * @vunmap: [optional] unmaps a vmap from the buffer
