/**
 * Radix-tree synchronization
 *
 * The radix-tree API requires that users provide all synchronisation (with
 * specific exceptions, noted below).
 *
 * Synchronization of access to the data items being stored in the tree, and
 * management of their lifetimes must be completely managed by API users.
 *
 * For API usage, in general,
 * - any function _modifying_ the tree or tags (inserting or deleting
 *   items, setting or clearing tags) must exclude other modifications, and
 *   exclude any functions reading the tree.
 * - any function _reading_ the tree or tags (looking up items or tags,
 *   gang lookups) must exclude modifications to the tree, but may occur
 *   concurrently with other readers.
 *
 * The notable exceptions to this rule are the following functions:
 * __radix_tree_lookup
 * radix_tree_lookup
 * radix_tree_lookup_slot
 * radix_tree_tag_get
 * radix_tree_gang_lookup
 * radix_tree_gang_lookup_slot
 * radix_tree_gang_lookup_tag
 * radix_tree_gang_lookup_tag_slot
 * radix_tree_tagged
 *
 * The first 7 functions are able to be called locklessly, using RCU. The
 * caller must ensure calls to these functions are made within rcu_read_lock()
 * regions. Other readers (lock-free or otherwise) and modifications may be
 * running concurrently.
 *
 * It is still required that the caller manage the synchronization and lifetimes
 * of the items. So if RCU lock-free lookups are used, typically this would mean
 * that the items have their own locks, or are amenable to lock-free access; and
 * that the items are freed by RCU (or only freed after having been deleted from
 * the radix tree *and* a synchronize_rcu() grace period).
 *
 * (Note, rcu_assign_pointer and rcu_dereference are not needed to control
 * access to data items when inserting into or looking up from the radix tree)
 *
 * Note that the value returned by radix_tree_tag_get() may not be relied upon
 * if only the RCU read lock is held.  Functions to set/clear tags and to
 * delete nodes running concurrently with it may affect its result such that
 * two consecutive reads in the same locked section may return different
 * values.  If reliability is required, modification functions must also be
 * excluded from concurrency.
 *
 * radix_tree_tagged is able to be called without locking or RCU.
