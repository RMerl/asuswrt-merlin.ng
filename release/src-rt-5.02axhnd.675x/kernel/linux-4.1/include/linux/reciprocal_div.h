/*
 * This algorithm is based on the paper "Division by Invariant
 * Integers Using Multiplication" by TorbjÃ¶rn Granlund and Peter
 * L. Montgomery.
 *
 * The assembler implementation from Agner Fog, which this code is
 * based on, can be found here:
 * http://www.agner.org/optimize/asmlib.zip
 *
 * This optimization for A/B is helpful if the divisor B is mostly
 * runtime invariant. The reciprocal of B is calculated in the
 * slow-path with reciprocal_value(). The fast-path can then just use
 * a much faster multiplication operation with a variable dividend A
 * to calculate the division A/B.
