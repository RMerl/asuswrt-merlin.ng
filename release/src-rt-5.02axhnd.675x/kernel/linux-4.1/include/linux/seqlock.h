/*
 * Reader/writer consistent mechanism without starving writers. This type of
 * lock for data where the reader wants a consistent set of information
 * and is willing to retry if the information changes. There are two types
 * of readers:
 * 1. Sequence readers which never block a writer but they may have to retry
 *    if a writer is in progress by detecting change in sequence number.
 *    Writers do not wait for a sequence reader.
 * 2. Locking readers which will wait if a writer or another locking reader
 *    is in progress. A locking reader in progress will also block a writer
 *    from going forward. Unlike the regular rwlock, the read lock here is
 *    exclusive so that only one locking reader can get it.
 *
 * This is not as cache friendly as brlock. Also, this may not work well
 * for data that contains pointers, because any writer could
 * invalidate a pointer that a reader was following.
 *
 * Expected non-blocking reader usage:
 * 	do {
 *	    seq = read_seqbegin(&foo);
 * 	...
 *      } while (read_seqretry(&foo, seq));
 *
 *
 * On non-SMP the spin locks disappear but the writer still needs
 * to increment the sequence variables because an interrupt routine could
 * change the state of the data.
 *
 * Based on x86_64 vsyscall gettimeofday 
 * by Keith Owens and Andrea Arcangeli
