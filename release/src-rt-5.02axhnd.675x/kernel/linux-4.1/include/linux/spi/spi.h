 * @unprepare_transfer_hardware: there are currently no more messages on the

 *                    transfer_one callback.
 * @handle_err: the subsystem calls the driver to handle an error that occurs
 *		in the generic implementation of transfer_one_message().

 * the chip is selected.
 *
 * The driver for an SPI controller manages access to those devices through

 * @tx_nbits: number of bits used for writing. If 0 the default

 * @speed_hz: Select a speed other than the device default for this
 *      transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @bits_per_word: select a bits_per_word other than the device default
 *      for this transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @cs_change: affects chipselect after this transfer completes
 * @delay_usecs: microseconds to delay after this transfer before
 *	(optionally) changing the chipselect status, then starting
 *	the next transfer or completing this @spi_message.
 * @transfer_list: transfers are sequenced through @spi_message.transfers
 * @tx_sg: Scatterlist for transmit, currently not for client use
 * @rx_sg: Scatterlist for receive, currently not for client use
 *
 * SPI transfers always write the same number of bytes as they read.
 * Protocol drivers should always provide @rx_buf and/or @tx_buf.
 * In some cases, they may also want to provide DMA addresses for
 * the data being transferred; that may reduce overhead, when the
 * underlying driver uses dma.
 *
 * If the transmit buffer is null, zeroes will be shifted out
 * while filling @rx_buf.  If the receive buffer is null, the data
 * shifted in will be discarded.  Only "len" bytes shift out (or in).
 * It's an error to try to shift out a partial word.  (For example, by
 * shifting out three bytes with word size of sixteen or twenty bits;
 * the former uses two bytes per word, the latter uses four bytes.)
 *
 * In-memory data values are always in native CPU byte order, translated
 * from the wire byte order (big-endian except with SPI_LSB_FIRST).  So
 * for example when bits_per_word is sixteen, buffers are 2N bytes long
 * (@len = 2N) and hold N sixteen bit words in CPU byte order.
 *
 * When the word size of the SPI transfer is not a power-of-two multiple
 * of eight bits, those in-memory words include extra bits.  In-memory
 * words are always seen by protocol drivers as right-justified, so the
 * undefined (rx) or unused (tx) bits are always the most significant bits.
 *
 * All SPI transfers start with the relevant chipselect active.  Normally
 * it stays selected until after the last transfer in a message.  Drivers
 * can affect the chipselect signal using cs_change.
 *
 * (i) If the transfer isn't the last one in the message, this flag is
 * used to make the chipselect briefly go inactive in the middle of the
 * message.  Toggling chipselect in this way may be needed to terminate
 * a chip command, letting a single spi_message perform all of group of
 * chip transactions together.
 *
 * (ii) When the transfer is the last one in the message, the chip may
 * stay selected until the next transfer.  On multi-device SPI busses
 * with nothing blocking messages going to other devices, this is just
 * a performance hint; starting a message to another device deselects
 * this one.  But in other cases, this can be used to ensure correctness.
 * Some devices need protocol transactions to be built from a series of
 * spi_message submissions, where the content of one message is determined
 * by the results of previous messages and where the whole transaction
 * ends when the chipselect goes intactive.
 *
 * When SPI can transfer in 1x,2x or 4x. It can get this transfer information
 * from device through @tx_nbits and @rx_nbits. In Bi-direction, these
 * two should both be set. User can set transfer mode with SPI_NBITS_SINGLE(1x)
 * SPI_NBITS_DUAL(2x) and SPI_NBITS_QUAD(4x) to support these three transfer.
 *
 * The code that submits an spi_message (and its spi_transfers)
 * to the lower layers is responsible for managing its memory.
 * Zero-initialize every field you don't set up explicitly, to
 * insulate against future API updates.  After you submit a message
 * and its transfers, ignore them until its completion callback.
