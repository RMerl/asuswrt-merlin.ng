/*
 * Overview:
 *
 * Events are subscribed per-filehandle. An event specification consists of a
 * type and is optionally associated with an object identified through the
 * 'id' field. So an event is uniquely identified by the (type, id) tuple.
 *
 * The v4l2-fh struct has a list of subscribed events. The v4l2_subscribed_event
 * struct is added to that list, one for every subscribed event.
 *
 * Each v4l2_subscribed_event struct ends with an array of v4l2_kevent structs.
 * This array (ringbuffer, really) is used to store any events raised by the
 * driver. The v4l2_kevent struct links into the 'available' list of the
 * v4l2_fh struct so VIDIOC_DQEVENT will know which event to dequeue first.
 *
 * Finally, if the event subscription is associated with a particular object
 * such as a V4L2 control, then that object needs to know about that as well
 * so that an event can be raised by that object. So the 'node' field can
 * be used to link the v4l2_subscribed_event struct into a list of that
 * object.
 *
 * So to summarize:
 *
 * struct v4l2_fh has two lists: one of the subscribed events, and one of the
 * pending events.
 *
 * struct v4l2_subscribed_event has a ringbuffer of raised (pending) events of
 * that particular type.
 *
 * If struct v4l2_subscribed_event is associated with a specific object, then
 * that object will have an internal list of struct v4l2_subscribed_event so
 * it knows who subscribed an event to that object.
