/**
 * struct vb2_mem_ops - memory handling/memory allocator operations
 * @alloc:	allocate video memory and, optionally, allocator private data,
 *		return NULL on failure or a pointer to allocator private,
 *		per-buffer data on success; the returned private structure
 *		will then be passed as buf_priv argument to other ops in this
 *		structure. Additional gfp_flags to use when allocating the
 *		are also passed to this operation. These flags are from the
 *		gfp_flags field of vb2_queue.
 * @put:	inform the allocator that the buffer will no longer be used;
 *		usually will result in the allocator freeing the buffer (if
 *		no other users of this buffer are present); the buf_priv
 *		argument is the allocator private per-buffer structure
 *		previously returned from the alloc callback.
 * @get_userptr: acquire userspace memory for a hardware operation; used for
 *		 USERPTR memory types; vaddr is the address passed to the
 *		 videobuf layer when queuing a video buffer of USERPTR type;
 *		 should return an allocator private per-buffer structure
 *		 associated with the buffer on success, NULL on failure;
 *		 the returned private structure will then be passed as buf_priv
 *		 argument to other ops in this structure.
 * @put_userptr: inform the allocator that a USERPTR buffer will no longer
 *		 be used.
 * @attach_dmabuf: attach a shared struct dma_buf for a hardware operation;
 *		   used for DMABUF memory types; alloc_ctx is the alloc context
 *		   dbuf is the shared dma_buf; returns NULL on failure;
 *		   allocator private per-buffer structure on success;
 *		   this needs to be used for further accesses to the buffer.
 * @detach_dmabuf: inform the exporter of the buffer that the current DMABUF
 *		   buffer is no longer used; the buf_priv argument is the
 *		   allocator private per-buffer structure previously returned
 *		   from the attach_dmabuf callback.
 * @map_dmabuf: request for access to the dmabuf from allocator; the allocator
 *		of dmabuf is informed that this driver is going to use the
 *		dmabuf.
 * @unmap_dmabuf: releases access control to the dmabuf - allocator is notified
 *		  that this driver is done using the dmabuf for now.
 * @prepare:	called every time the buffer is passed from userspace to the
 *		driver, useful for cache synchronisation, optional.
 * @finish:	called every time the buffer is passed back from the driver
 *		to the userspace, also optional.
 * @vaddr:	return a kernel virtual address to a given memory buffer
 *		associated with the passed private structure or NULL if no
 *		such mapping exists.
 * @cookie:	return allocator specific cookie for a given memory buffer
 *		associated with the passed private structure or NULL if not
 *		available.
 * @num_users:	return the current number of users of a memory buffer;
 *		return 1 if the videobuf layer (or actually the driver using
 *		it) is the only user.
 * @mmap:	setup a userspace mapping for a given memory buffer under
 *		the provided virtual memory region.
 *
 * Required ops for USERPTR types: get_userptr, put_userptr.
 * Required ops for MMAP types: alloc, put, num_users, mmap.
 * Required ops for read/write access types: alloc, put, num_users, vaddr.
 * Required ops for DMABUF types: attach_dmabuf, detach_dmabuf, map_dmabuf,
 *				  unmap_dmabuf.

/**
 * struct vb2_ops - driver-specific callbacks
 *
 * @queue_setup:	called from VIDIOC_REQBUFS and VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS
 *			handlers before memory allocation, or, if
 *			*num_planes != 0, after the allocation to verify a
 *			smaller number of buffers. Driver should return
 *			the required number of buffers in *num_buffers, the
 *			required number of planes per buffer in *num_planes; the
 *			size of each plane should be set in the sizes[] array
 *			and optional per-plane allocator specific context in the
 *			alloc_ctxs[] array. When called from VIDIOC_REQBUFS,
 *			fmt == NULL, the driver has to use the currently
 *			configured format and *num_buffers is the total number
 *			of buffers, that are being allocated. When called from
 *			VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS, fmt != NULL and it describes the
 *			target frame format (if the format isn't valid the
 *			callback must return -EINVAL). In this case *num_buffers
 *			are being allocated additionally to q->num_buffers.
 * @wait_prepare:	release any locks taken while calling vb2 functions;
 *			it is called before an ioctl needs to wait for a new
 *			buffer to arrive; required to avoid a deadlock in
 *			blocking access type.
 * @wait_finish:	reacquire all locks released in the previous callback;
 *			required to continue operation after sleeping while
 *			waiting for a new buffer to arrive.
 * @buf_init:		called once after allocating a buffer (in MMAP case)
 *			or after acquiring a new USERPTR buffer; drivers may
 *			perform additional buffer-related initialization;
 *			initialization failure (return != 0) will prevent
 *			queue setup from completing successfully; optional.
 * @buf_prepare:	called every time the buffer is queued from userspace
 *			and from the VIDIOC_PREPARE_BUF ioctl; drivers may
 *			perform any initialization required before each
 *			hardware operation in this callback; drivers can
 *			access/modify the buffer here as it is still synced for
 *			the CPU; drivers that support VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS must
 *			also validate the buffer size; if an error is returned,
 *			the buffer will not be queued in driver; optional.
 * @buf_finish:		called before every dequeue of the buffer back to
 *			userspace; the buffer is synced for the CPU, so drivers
 *			can access/modify the buffer contents; drivers may
 *			perform any operations required before userspace
 *			accesses the buffer; optional. The buffer state can be
 *			one of the following: DONE and ERROR occur while
 *			streaming is in progress, and the PREPARED state occurs
 *			when the queue has been canceled and all pending
 *			buffers are being returned to their default DEQUEUED
 *			state. Typically you only have to do something if the
 *			state is VB2_BUF_STATE_DONE, since in all other cases
 *			the buffer contents will be ignored anyway.
 * @buf_cleanup:	called once before the buffer is freed; drivers may
 *			perform any additional cleanup; optional.
 * @start_streaming:	called once to enter 'streaming' state; the driver may
 *			receive buffers with @buf_queue callback before
 *			@start_streaming is called; the driver gets the number
 *			of already queued buffers in count parameter; driver
 *			can return an error if hardware fails, in that case all
 *			buffers that have been already given by the @buf_queue
 *			callback are to be returned by the driver by calling
 *			@vb2_buffer_done(VB2_BUF_STATE_QUEUED).
 *			If you need a minimum number of buffers before you can
 *			start streaming, then set @min_buffers_needed in the
 *			vb2_queue structure. If that is non-zero then
 *			start_streaming won't be called until at least that
 *			many buffers have been queued up by userspace.
 * @stop_streaming:	called when 'streaming' state must be disabled; driver
 *			should stop any DMA transactions or wait until they
 *			finish and give back all buffers it got from buf_queue()
 *			callback by calling @vb2_buffer_done() with either
 *			VB2_BUF_STATE_DONE or VB2_BUF_STATE_ERROR; may use
 *			vb2_wait_for_all_buffers() function
 * @buf_queue:		passes buffer vb to the driver; driver may start
 *			hardware operation on this buffer; driver should give
 *			the buffer back by calling vb2_buffer_done() function;
 *			it is allways called after calling STREAMON ioctl;
 *			might be called before start_streaming callback if user
 *			pre-queued buffers before calling STREAMON.
