 * This IOCTL is used to associate the current file descriptor with a
 * FW Client (given by UUID). This opens a communication channel
 * between a host client and a FW client. From this point every read and write
 * will communicate with the associated FW client.
 * Only in close() (file_operation release()) the communication between
 * the clients is disconnected
 *
 * The IOCTL argument is a struct with a union that contains
 * the input parameter and the output parameter for this IOCTL.
 *
 * The input parameter is UUID of the FW Client.
 * The output parameter is the properties of the FW client
 * (FW protocol version and max message size).
