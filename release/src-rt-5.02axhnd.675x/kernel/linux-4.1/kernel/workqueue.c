 * automatically managed.  There are two worker pools for each CPU (one for
 * normal work items and the other for high priority ones) and some extra
 * pools for workqueues which are not bound to any specific CPU - the
 * number of these backing pools is dynamic.
 *
 * Please read Documentation/workqueue.txt for details.
