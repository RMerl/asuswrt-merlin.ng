	help
	  This option allows a kernel builder to override the default choice
	  of CRC32 algorithm.  Choose the default ("slice by 8") unless you
	  know that you need one of the others.

config CRC32_SLICEBY8
	bool "Slice by 8 bytes"
	help
	  Calculate checksum 8 bytes at a time with a clever slicing algorithm.
	  This is the fastest algorithm, but comes with a 8KiB lookup table.
	  Most modern processors have enough cache to hold this table without
	  thrashing the cache.

	  This is the default implementation choice.  Choose this one unless
	  you have a good reason not to.

config CRC32_SLICEBY4
	bool "Slice by 4 bytes"
	help
	  Calculate checksum 4 bytes at a time with a clever slicing algorithm.
	  This is a bit slower than slice by 8, but has a smaller 4KiB lookup
	  table.

	  Only choose this option if you know what you are doing.

config CRC32_SARWATE
	bool "Sarwate's Algorithm (one byte at a time)"
	help
	  Calculate checksum a byte at a time using Sarwate's algorithm.  This
	  is not particularly fast, but has a small 256 byte lookup table.

	  Only choose this option if you know what you are doing.

config CRC32_BIT

	help
	  Calculate checksum one bit at a time.  This is VERY slow, but has
	  no lookup table.  This is provided as a debugging option.

	  Only choose this option if you are debugging crc32.

config BCH_CONST_PARAMS
	bool
	help
	  Drivers may select this option to force specific constant
	  values for parameters 'm' (Galois field order) and 't'
	  (error correction capability). Those specific values must
	  be set by declaring default values for symbols BCH_CONST_M
	  and BCH_CONST_T.
	  Doing so will enable extra compiler optimizations,
	  improving encoding and decoding performance up to 2x for
	  usual (m,t) values (typically such that m*t < 200).
	  When this option is selected, the BCH library supports
	  only a single (m,t) configuration. This is mainly useful
	  for NAND flash board drivers requiring known, fixed BCH
	  parameters.

config BCH_CONST_M
	int
	range 5 15
	help
	  Constant value for Galois field order 'm'. If 'k' is the
	  number of data bits to protect, 'm' should be chosen such
	  that (k + m*t) <= 2**m - 1.
	  Drivers should declare a default value for this symbol if
	  they select option BCH_CONST_PARAMS.

config BCH_CONST_T

	  augmented rbtree.

	  See:

config ASSOCIATIVE_ARRAY
	bool

	  Generic associative array.  Can be searched and iterated over whilst

	  capacious.

config GLOB
	bool
#	This actually supports modular compilation, but the module overhead
#	is ridiculous for the amount of code involved.	Until an out-of-tree
#	driver asks for it, we'll just link it directly it into the kernel
#	when required.  Since we're ignoring out-of-tree users,	there's also
#	no need bother prompting for a manual decision:
#	prompt "glob_match() function"
	help
	  This option provides a glob_match function for performing
	  simple text pattern matching.  It originated in the ATA code
	  to blacklist particular drive models, but other device drivers
	  may need similar functionality.

	  All drivers in the Linux kernel tree that require this function
	  should automatically select this option.  Say N unless you
	  are compiling an out-of tree driver which tells you that it
	  depends on this.

config GLOB_SELFTEST
	bool "glob self-test on init"
	default n
	depends on GLOB
	help
	  This option enables a simple self-test of the glob_match
	  function on startup.	It is primarily useful for people
	  working on the code to ensure they haven't introduced any
	  regressions.

	  It only adds a little bit of code and slows kernel boot (or
	  module load) by a small amount, so you're welcome to play with
	  it, but you probably don't need it.
