	---help---
	  Extend memmap on extra space for more information on page. This
	  could be used for debugging features that need to insert extra
	  field for every page. This extension enables us to save memory
	  by not allocating this extra memory according to boottime
	  configuration.

	bool "Debug page memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	depends on !HIBERNATION || ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC && !PPC && !SPARC

	---help---
	  Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages().
	  This results in a large slowdown, but helps to find certain types
	  of memory corruption.

	  For architectures which don't enable ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC,
	  fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify
	  the patterns before alloc_pages().  Additionally,
	  this option cannot be enabled in combination with hibernation as
	  that would result in incorrect warnings of memory corruption after
	  a resume because free pages are not saved to the suspend image.
