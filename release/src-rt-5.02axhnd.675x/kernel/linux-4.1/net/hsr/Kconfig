	---help---
	  If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as a
	  DANH ("Doubly attached node implementing HSR"). For this to work,
	  your Linux box needs (at least) two physical Ethernet interfaces,
	  and it must be connected as a node in a ring network together with
	  other HSR capable nodes.

	  All Ethernet frames sent over the hsr device will be sent in both
	  directions on the ring (over both slave ports), giving a redundant,
	  instant fail-over network. Each HSR node in the ring acts like a
	  bridge for HSR frames, but filters frames that have been forwarded
	  earlier.

	  This code is a "best effort" to comply with the HSR standard as
	  described in IEC 62439-3:2010 (HSRv0), but no compliancy tests have
	  been made.

	  You need to perform any and all necessary tests yourself before
	  relying on this code in a safety critical system!

	  If unsure, say N.
