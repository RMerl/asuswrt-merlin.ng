	  The Modem-Host Interface (MHI) is a packet-oriented transport protocol
	  developed by Renesas Mobile for use with their modems.

	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  L2 MUX is a protocol layer in the MHI stack. It is required
	  by the MHI L3 components.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called l2mux. If unsure, say Y.

config MHI_L3MHI

	select MHI_L2MUX
	default y
	help
	  AF_MHI provides datagram access to L2 channels in MHI,
	  developed by Renesas Mobile for use with their modems.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the modules
	  will be called l3mhi and af_mhi. If unsure, say Y.

	help
	  L3 PHONET protocol for MHI protocol family,
	  developed by Renesas Mobile for use with their modems.

	  This driver is a bridge between MHI L3 Phonet and Phonet Protocol Family.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called l3phonet. If unsure, say Y.

	default y
	help
	  Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within
	  another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the
	  encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements
	  encapsulation of IP within MHDP (Modem Host Data Protocol), which
	  is used for communication between the APE and the Modem.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called l3mhdp. If unsure, say Y.

config MHI_DEBUG
	bool "MHI Debugging"
	default n
	help
	  Generate lots of debugging messages in the MHI stack.
	  This option is useful when developing MHI. Otherwise it should be off.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MHI_DUMP_FRAMES
	bool "Dump MHI frames on L2 layer"
	default n
	help
	  Print out every frame passed through L2MUX into kernel log.
	  This option is useful when developing MHI. Otherwise it should be off.

	  If unsure, say N.
