config VSOCKETS
	tristate "Virtual Socket protocol"
	help
	  Virtual Socket Protocol is a socket protocol similar to TCP/IP
	  allowing communication between Virtual Machines and hypervisor
	  or host.

	  You should also select one or more hypervisor-specific transports
	  below.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called vsock. If unsure, say N.

config VMWARE_VMCI_VSOCKETS
	tristate "VMware VMCI transport for Virtual Sockets"
	depends on VSOCKETS && VMWARE_VMCI
	help
	  This module implements a VMCI transport for Virtual Sockets.

	  Enable this transport if your Virtual Machine runs on a VMware
	  hypervisor.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called vmw_vsock_vmci_transport. If unsure, say N.
