ToDos sorted by priority:

- Use bitmask functions to parse CPU topology more robust
  (current implementation has issues on AMD)
- Try to read out boost states and frequencies on Intel
- Somewhere saw the ability to read power consumption of
  RAM from HW on Intel SandyBridge -> another monitor?
- Add another c1e debug idle monitor
  -> Is by design racy with BIOS, but could be added
     with a --force option and some "be careful" messages
