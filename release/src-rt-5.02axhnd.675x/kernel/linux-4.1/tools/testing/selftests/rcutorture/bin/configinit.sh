# Usage: configinit.sh config-spec-file [ build output dir ]
#
# Create a .config file from the spec file.  Run from the kernel source tree.
# Exits with 0 if all went well, with 1 if all went well but the config
# did not match, and some other number for other failures.
#
# The first argument is the .config specification file, which contains
# desired settings, for example, "CONFIG_NO_HZ=y".  For best results,
# this should be a full pathname.
#
# The second argument is a optional path to a build output directory,
# for example, "O=/tmp/foo".  If this argument is omitted, the .config
# file will be generated directly in the current directory.
