/** \defgroup bridge Bridge
 * RDPA supports multiple 802.1d/q bridges.\n
 * L2 bridge functionality:
 * - All bridge objects share the same MAC table (named FDB=forwarding DataBase)
 *	 - Use ::rdpa_bridge_mac_set to add/delete MAC entry to/from the FDB
 * - Each bridge object is compounded of interfaces of the folowing type:
 *   - Port object  bridge interface without VLAN configuration
 *   - VLAN object - bridge interface with VLAN configuration
 *   - Use ::bdmf_link to associate an interface (Port/VLAN) to the bridge
 * - The port forwording matrix is updated each time a new interface is added to the bridge object:
 * - The new interface (Port/VLAN) can forword packets to all interfaces under the same bridge
