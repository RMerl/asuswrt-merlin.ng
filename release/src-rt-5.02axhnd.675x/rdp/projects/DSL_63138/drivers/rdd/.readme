This directory is a placeholder for DSL project specific RDD files. As initial version, it can contain the sources and
header files from //depot/CommEngine/prod/PROD_416L/shared/broadcom/rdp/impl2/rdd/.
Please note that this directory also includes auto-generated files (by table-manager), which are updated during firmware
build. After they are changed, they should be submitted to P4. 

Makefile should not be changed.
