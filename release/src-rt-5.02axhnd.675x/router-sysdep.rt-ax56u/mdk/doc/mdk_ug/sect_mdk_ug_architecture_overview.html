    <h2>2.  Architecture Overview
</h2>
<p>The Mini Driver Kit (MDK) is divided into three separate components,
which are the Chip Development Kit (CDK) and the Broadcom Mini Driver
(BMD) and the PHY Driver Library (PDL).
<p>The CDK provides a full description of all chip blocks, registers and
memories and includes a low-level interface for reading and writing
registers and memories. The CDK has no abstractions, i.e. all register
and memory access is chip-specific. The CDK also includes a simple
debug shell that provides symbolic or raw access to the chip
registers.
<p>The BMD is a simple API built on top of the CDK, and it optionally
adds corresponding shell commands to the CDK debug shell.
<p>The PHY Driver Library is actually a separate component, which can be
used in other applications not involving the BMD, however for any real
BMD applications, one or more PHY drivers must be included.
<p>In addition to the MDK components, an MDK-based application must also
provide a basic system interface for hardware registers access and
optionally console I/O.

All application components will be explained in detail in the
following sections.
