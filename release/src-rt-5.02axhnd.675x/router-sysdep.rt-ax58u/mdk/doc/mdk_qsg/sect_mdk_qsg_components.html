    <h2>2.  MDK Components
</h2>
<p>The MDK actually contains several independent packages, which may be
updated separately.  The following diagram provides an overview of the
MDK components and external interfaces:

<h3>2.1.   Chip Development Kit (CDK)</h3>
<p>The CDK contains the basic building blocks for creating a software
driver for Broadcom Ethernet switch devices.  The CDK is organized as
a self-contained library, which includes a very basic C library
implementation and as well as a basic debug shell implementation.
<p>The CDK library also contains the most basic access functions for each
supported switch chip architecture, however it is rarely necessary to
access these functions directly.  Instead, register access and
manipulation should be done through the provided set of access-macros,
which can be found in the CDK include directory:
<pre class="code">
$CDK/include/cdk/chip/&lt;chipname&gt;<tt>_defs</tt>.h
</pre>
The CDK debug shell provides symbolic access to registers through a
set of symbols tables, however if the register access-macros are used
in a driver implementations, it is not required to include the symbol
tables.  This design allows simple drivers to be very small in size
and suitable for inclusion in e.g. boot loaders.

<h3>2.2.   Broadcom Mini Driver (BMD)</h3>
<p>The BMD provides a simple API to the most basic switch functions
including initialization of unmanaged switching and packet transfer
between the switch chip and the host CPU. All necessary definitions
for using the BMD API are found in:
<pre class="code">
$BMD/include/bmd/bmd.h
</pre>
The BMD implementation also serves as examples of how to use the
register access macros provided by the CDK.  The chip-specific API
driver implementations can be found in the BMD chip directory:
<pre class="code">
$BMD/chip/&lt;chipname&gt;
</pre>
The BMD includes extensions for the CDK debug shell, which allows most
BMD APIs to be exercised.

<h3>2.3.   PHY Driver Library</h3>
<p>The PHY library provides a common interface to Ethernet PHYs and
includes support for a number of Broadcom PHYs. The PHY library
requires the presence of the CDK, but it should be considered an
independent component, which can be updated or expanded without
changing the CDK.
