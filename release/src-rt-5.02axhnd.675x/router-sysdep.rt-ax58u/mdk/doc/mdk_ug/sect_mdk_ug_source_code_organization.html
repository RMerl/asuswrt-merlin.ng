    <h2>3.  Source Code Organization
</h2>
<p>The CDK, BMD and PHY libraries are organized 
into a modular structure that separates chip-specific source files
from the core libraries. With this structure, support for a new chip
can be added without modifying any existing source files. Furthermore
it significantly reduces compilation time as you only need to compile
source files that are relevant to a specific project.

<h3>3.1.   Common Package Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Each of the CDK, BMD and PHY libraries implement a similar framework
for package distribution and installation.
<p>Within each library, packages reside in a directory named PKG and the
perl-based package installation tools reside in the tools directory,
e.g. for the BMD those directories would be $MDK/bmd/PKG and
$MDK/bmd/tools.
<p>All packages must include a PKGINFO file, which carries information
about package version and dependencies. A typical PKGINFO file looks
like this:
<pre class="code">
VERSION:2.1
NAME:bcm56502
ARCH:xgs
DEPEND:bcm56504
</pre>
Before a library can be compiled, the available packages must be
installed into the primary source tree. Most package files will be
copied to the a directory named pkgsrc, while some package stub files
are combined into a single source file, typically in the include
directory or the sym directory.
<p>A library's main makefile includes targets for installing and removing
packages, and the main make target will ensure that packages are
installed before the library is compiled. After all package files have
been installed, the package installer will create the file
pkgsrc/installed-chips which contains names and versions of currently
installed packages. This file is used to check if packages need to be
reinstalled, e.g. if a package is updated or a new package is added to
the PKG directory.

<h3>3.2.   Package Versioning</h3>
<p>The MDK libraries use a major and minor version number X.Y and package
compatibility is only guaranteed for base libraries and packages with
the same version number.
<p>As a general rule, the package installer will refuse to install
mismatching package versions, however patch releases with version
numbers X.Y.Z should be compatible X.Y package versions and will be
accepted by the installer.
