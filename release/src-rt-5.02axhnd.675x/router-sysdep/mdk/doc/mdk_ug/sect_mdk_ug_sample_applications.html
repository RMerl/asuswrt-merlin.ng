    <h2>7.  Sample Applications
</h2>
<p>The MDK provides two simple sample applications which demonstrate 
how to initialize and use the MDK components. 
<a name="mdk_ug_building_the_sample_applications"></a>
<h3>7.1.   Building the Sample Applications</h3>
<p>The sample applications are located in the <tt>example</tt> directory within the
MDK source tree. All makefiles contain the basic instructions for
building the applications and all rely on certain environment variables to be set. 
Below is an example of how to set these variable using the bash shell:
<pre class="code">
bash# export MDK=~/brcm/mdk-2.0
bash# export CDK=$MDK/cdk
bash# export BMD=$MDK/bmd
bash# export PHY=$MDK/phy
</pre>
<p><a name="mdk_ug_basic_cdk_shell"></a>
<h3>7.2.   Basic CDK Shell Simulator</h3>
<p>The <tt>cdksim</tt> application is a very simple application that
demonstrates how to use the CDK device package and CDK Shell. 
<p>The <tt>cdksim</tt> application provides a simple emulation of a handful
of Broadcom devices and allows you to explore the features of the CDK shell
by initializing the CDK Shell using those simulations. 
It can be run natively on the build system and does not require real hardware. 
<p>On a Linux system, simply go to the example/cdksim directory and run
<tt>gmake.</tt> The Makefile includes examples of how the <tt>gmake</tt> command line
option can be used to change the destination directory, flags, options, and other
aspects of the CDK build. 
<p><a name="mdk_ug_example_linux"></a>
<h3>7.3.   Basic Linux Usermode MDK Application</h3>
<p>The <tt>linux-user-mdk</tt> sample application demonstrates how to initialize and use
the CDK, BMD, and PHY libraries on a real device. 
<p>Devices are created by specifying the <tt>vendor,</tt><tt>device,</tt><tt>revision,</tt> and <tt>base_address</tt> as
arguments on the command line to the application. These arguments are used to create a device context
in the CDK, attach the BMD driver, and initialize the CDK, BMD, and PHY shell services. 
<p>The device information needed to initialize the application in a real system can be retrieved using the
<tt>lspci</tt> command at your system prompt. 
<p>NOTE: The sample functions on real hardware by <tt>mmapping()</tt> the device's base address. There is no
support for DMA in this sample application and the BMD TX/RX commands will not function. 
<p><a name="mdk_ug_cfe_integration"></a>
<h3>7.4.   CFE Integration</h3>
<p>The MDK has been integrated into the CFE (Common Firmware Environment)
to demonstrate how the MDK can be used to initialize basic L2
switching from the CFE boot loader. It is also possible to run a
network interface on top of the BMD driver, and this allows software
images to be loaded via the front panel ports, which eliminates the
need for a dedicated management network port for e.g. firmware
upgrades.
<p>If the MDK is compiled into the CFE with the <tt>CFG_MDK_DEBUG</tt> set to 1, a
number of additional CFE shell commands will installed, of which the
most important ones are described below. Use the CFE help function for
additional help on the MDK shell commands.
<a name="mdk_ug_mdk_probe"></a>
<h4>7.4.1.   mdk probe</h4>
<p>Use this command to probe for MDK devices.
<p><a name="mdk_ug_mdk_swinit"></a>
<h4>7.4.2.   mdk swinit</h4>
<p> This command will execute the  <a href="sect_bmd_api_function_reference.html#bmd_switching_init"><tt>bmd_switching_init</tt></a>  API function on an
MDK device, i.e. the MDK device will be initialized as an unmanaged
switch. Note that the mdk probe command must be run prior to this
command.
<p><a name="mdk_ug_mdk_netinit"></a>
<h4>7.4.3.   mdk netinit</h4>
<p>This command probes for MDK devices and installs a CFE network driver
on top of the BMD API. To switch from the default network device to
the MDK network device, run e.g. the following commands (this assumes
that a front panel port has been hooked up to a network with a DHCP
server):
<pre class="code">
CFE&gt; mdk netinit
CFE&gt; show devices
CFE&gt; ifconfig eth0 -off
CFE&gt; ifconfig eth1 -auto
</pre>
<p><a name="mdk_ug_mdk_shell"></a>
<h4>7.4.4.   mdk shell</h4>
<p>This command enters an MDK shell, which provides access to both the
CDK shell commands and the BMD shell commands. For detailed help, run
the following commands:
<pre class="code">
CFE&gt; mdk shell
MDK&gt; help
</pre>
To return to the CFE shell, simply type quit or exit at the MDK
prompt.
