    as this is considered a successful boot. Otherwise, if system becomes unresponsive during the Watchdog tracking 
    CFEROM on SoftReset determines the reason of the crash then switches to previously installed or fallback image. 
    If fallback image is also crashed - CFEROM halts the system. 
    Default Watchdog delays are - CFEROM CFERAM both are given 30s for Watchdog timer to exppire. Linux given 60s.
