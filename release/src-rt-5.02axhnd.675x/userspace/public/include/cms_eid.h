/*!\file cms_eid.h
 * \brief Header file containing entity id assignments in
 * the CPE Management System (CMS).
 */


/*!\enum CmsEntityId
 * \brief Entity Id's (eid) are like process id's (pid), except they identify an
 * application in general, not the specific instance of that application.
 *
 * For example, the ppp application has an entity id of 22.  That entity id
 * refers to the ppp application in general, not a specific instance of ppp,
 * which is uniquely identified by its process id (pid).
 * 
 * Entity Id's are used by the various CMS API's to identify its caller.
 * They are also used by the messaging sub-system to identify the source
 * and destination of messages.  In most cases, there is only one instance
 * of a particular application, so specifying the CmsEntityId is enough to
 * identify the application.  However, for applications that may have multiple
 * instances, additional steps may be required.  (For details on how
 * to identify an application for the purpose of sending or receiving messages,
 * see cms_msg.h).
 *
 * The first 15 eid's (1-15) are special because they are apps whose access
 * to the MDM can be controlled using the TR69 protocol.  See eid_bcm_mgmt.txt
 *
 * Adding an EID to this file has the benefit of preventing multiple uses
 * of the same EID, but adding an EID here is optional (CMS still works
 * if an EID is not defined here).  Broadcom developers should continue to
 * add EID's here, but third party developers do not need to.  Instead,
 * please follow the allocation ranges below to avoid conflicts.

/** TR-069 A.3.2.4 describes how the ACS is able to use the
 * setParameterAttributes RPC to control MDM write access by
 * "subscriber LAN side configuration apps", and how the ACS is always allowed
 * to write to writable parameters.
 *
 * The implementation in CMS does not follow this description exactly.
 * In CMS, there are 15 bits in
 * MdmNodeAttributes.accessBitMask which controls write access to writable
 * params.  The first bit controls access by tr69c itself (so in CMS it is
 * possible to deny write access to the ACS/tr69c).  The other bits are
 * allocated to other management apps, such as httpd or tr64c.  Note that CMS
 * does not distinguish between WAN side or LAN side apps.  Apps are either
 * granted access or not; and whether the app is communicating out of the LAN
 * side or the WAN side is controlled by other access controls in CMS.  Also note
 * that in CMS, the access is controlled on an individual app basis, whereas
 * the TR69 spec only talks about controlling (all) "subscriber LAN side apps".
 * All the individual app control bits are or'd together to form
 * NDA_ACCESS_SUBSCRIBER, which is roughly equivalent to the "subscriber LAN
 * side apps" described in TR69.
 *
 * If an app has a NDA_ACCESS_xxx bit defined for it, the bit must be listed
 * in the "accessBit" field of its CmsEntityInfo entry (see CMS Developer's
 * Guide Section 19).  Also, if the app calls cmsMdm_initWithAcc, the
 * accessBit must be passed in the second param.
 *
 * Some apps are considered "internal" to the system and not really a
 * management app.  They cannot be denied write access to writable params,
 * and in fact, should be allowed to write even the read-only params --
 * think about an app that updates the statistics or status params.
 * These "internal" apps should not be assigned a NDA_ACCESS_xxx bit, but
 * instead, their EID should be listed in the fullWriteAccessEidArray
 * in userspace/private/libs/cms_core/mdm_binaryhelper.c.
 *
 * All apps which need write access the MDM must either have an
 * NDA_ACCESS_xxx bit defined for it or be listed in the
 * fullWriteAccessEidArray.  (Apps which only need read-only access do not
 * need either of these.)
