 * \brief Header file for the CMS Process Control API.
 *
 *  Process control functions are included in the cms_util library.
 *  Process control is intended primary for smd, which is supposed
 *  to manage all process spawning, and for the unittests.  The RCL
 *  handler functions may also use them as we slowly transition from
 *  the 3.x implementation to the new CMS (4.x) implementation.
 *
 *  Typically, management applications should not need to call process
 *  control functions directly.  Instead, they should interact with the
 *  MDM and let the RCL handler functions spawn the appropriate daemons
 *  or spawn commands to do system actions.
