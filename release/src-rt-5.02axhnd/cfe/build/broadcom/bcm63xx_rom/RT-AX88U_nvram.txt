# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from an 8/16 split between macmid and the serial number, to a 12/12 split,
# so the new macmid will be based on MAC addresses with the following format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  XY   |  YY   |
# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 23:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,
# the whole OUI (00:90:4C) will be prepended to those values and 12 bits of serial number will be appended.
#
# A new-style macmid:
#   BCM947186nrh  0x008
#
# For router boards, nvserial now defines a new variable: "maclo12"
# so NVRAM text files for new boards will have to define the MAC address like this (for a macmid 0x008):
#   et0macaddr=00:90:4C:00:8${maclo12}
# instead of the previous way:
