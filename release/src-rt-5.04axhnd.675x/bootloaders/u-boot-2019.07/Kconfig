config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version - append to U-Boot release"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of your U-Boot version.
	  This will show up in your boot log, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO

	default y
	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for Git tags that belong to the current
	  top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a Git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  (The actual string used here is the first eight characters produced
	  by running the command:

	    $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD

	  which is done within the script "scripts/setlocalversion".)

	help
	  This option allows certain base U-Boot options and settings

	  Use this only if you really know what you are doing.

if EXPERT
	config SYS_MALLOC_CLEAR_ON_INIT
	bool "Init with zeros the memory reserved for malloc (slow)"
	default y
	help
	  This setting is enabled by default. The reserved malloc
	  memory is initialized with zeros, so first malloc calls
	  will return the pointer to the zeroed memory. But this
	  slows the boot time.

	  It is recommended to disable it, when CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN
	  value, has more than few MiB, e.g. when uses bzip2 or bmp logo.
	  Then the boot time can be significantly reduced.
	  Warning:
	  When disabling this, please check if malloc calls, maybe
	  should be replaced by calloc - if one expects zeroed memory.

config TOOLS_DEBUG

	help
	  Enable generation of debug information for tools such as mkimage.

	  for the ile "u-boot.lds" and use that as our linker.  However, in
	  some cases we need to provide a different linker script.  To do so,

config FIT
	bool "Support Flattened Image Tree"
	select MD5
	select SHA1
	help
	  This option allows you to boot the new uImage structure,
	  Flattened Image Tree.  FIT is formally a FDT, which can include
	  images of various types (kernel, FDT blob, ramdisk, etc.)
	  in a single blob.  To boot this new uImage structure,
	  pass the address of the blob to the "bootm" command.
	  FIT is very flexible, supporting compression, multiple images,
	  multiple configurations, verification through hashing and also
	  verified boot (secure boot using RSA).

config FIT_EXTERNAL_OFFSET
	hex "FIT external data offset"

	  This specifies a data offset in fit image.
	  The offset is from data payload offset to the beginning of

config FIT_ENABLE_SHA256_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SHA256 checksum of FIT image contents"
	default y
	select SHA256
	help
	  Enable this to support SHA256 checksum of FIT image contents. A
	  SHA256 checksum is a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value used to check that
	  the image contents have not been corrupted. SHA256 is recommended
	  for use in secure applications since (as at 2016) there is no known
	  feasible attack that could produce a 'collision' with differing
	  input data. Use this for the highest security. Note that only the
	  SHA256 variant is supported: SHA512 and others are not currently
	  supported in U-Boot.

config FIT_SIGNATURE
	bool "Enable signature verification of FIT uImages"
	depends on DM
	select HASH
	select RSA
	help
	  This option enables signature verification of FIT uImages,
	  using a hash signed and verified using RSA. If
	  CONFIG_SHA_PROG_HW_ACCEL is defined, i.e support for progressive
	  hashing is available using hardware, then the RSA library will use
	  it. See doc/uImage.FIT/signature.txt for more details.

	  WARNING: When relying on signed FIT images with a required signature
	  check the legacy image format is disabled by default, so that
	  unsigned images cannot be loaded. If a board needs the legacy image
	  format support in this case, enable it using
	  CONFIG_IMAGE_FORMAT_LEGACY.

config FIT_SIGNATURE_MAX_SIZE
	hex "Max size of signed FIT structures"
	depends on FIT_SIGNATURE
	default 0x10000000
	help
	  This option sets a max size in bytes for verified FIT uImages.
	  A sane value of 256MB protects corrupted DTB structures from overlapping
	  device memory. Assure this size does not extend past expected storage
	  space.

config FIT_ENABLE_RSASSA_PSS_SUPPORT
	bool "Support rsassa-pss signature scheme of FIT image contents"
	depends on FIT_SIGNATURE
	default n

	  Enable this to support the pss padding algorithm as described
	  in the rfc8017 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017).

config FIT_VERBOSE
	bool "Show verbose messages when FIT images fail"
	help
	  Generally a system will have valid FIT images so debug messages
	  are a waste of code space. If you are debugging your images then
	  you can enable this option to get more verbose information about
	  failures.

config FIT_BEST_MATCH
	bool "Select the best match for the kernel device tree"
	help
	  When no configuration is explicitly selected, default to the
	  one whose fdt's compatibility field best matches that of
	  U-Boot itself. A match is considered "best" if it matches the
	  most specific compatibility entry of U-Boot's fdt's root node.
	  The order of entries in the configuration's fdt is ignored.

config FIT_IMAGE_POST_PROCESS
	bool "Enable post-processing of FIT artifacts after loading by U-Boot"
	depends on TI_SECURE_DEVICE
	help
	  Allows doing any sort of manipulation to blobs after they got extracted
	  from FIT images like stripping off headers or modifying the size of the
	  blob, verification, authentication, decryption etc. in a platform or
	  board specific way. In order to use this feature a platform or board-
	  specific implementation of board_fit_image_post_process() must be
	  provided. Also, anything done during this post-processing step would
	  need to be comprehended in how the images were prepared before being
