	  The default exception vector table is only used for the crash

	  Say Y here if there is not any trust firmware to set
	  CPUECTLR_EL1.SMPEN bit before U-Boot.

	  For A53, it enables data coherency with other cores in the
	  cluster, and for A57/A72, it enables receiving of instruction
	  cache and TLB maintenance operations.
	  Cortex A53/57/72 cores require CPUECTLR_EL1.SMPEN set even
	  for single core systems. Unfortunately write access to this
	  register may be controlled by EL3/EL2 firmware. To be more
	  precise, by default (if there is EL2/EL3 firmware running)
	  this register is RO for NS EL1.
	  This switch can be used to avoid writing to CPUECTLR_EL1,
	  it can be safely enabled when EL2/EL3 initialized SMPEN bit
	  or when CPU implementation doesn't include that register.

	bool "Support spin-table enable method"
	depends on ARMV8_MULTIENTRY && OF_LIBFDT
	help
	  Say Y here to support "spin-table" enable method for booting Linux.

	  To use this feature, you must do:
	    - Specify enable-method = "spin-table" in each CPU node in the
	      Device Tree you are using to boot the kernel
	    - Bring secondary CPUs into U-Boot proper in a board specific
	      manner.  This must be done *after* relocation.  Otherwise, the
	      secondary CPUs will spin in unprotected memory area because the
	      master CPU protects the relocated spin code.

	  U-Boot automatically does:
	    - Set "cpu-release-addr" property of each CPU node
	      (overwrites it if already exists).
	    - Reserve the code for the spin-table and the release address
	      via a /memreserve/ region in the Device Tree.

	  Most armv8 systems have PSCI support enabled in EL3, either through

	  On these systems, we do not need to implement system reset manually,
