config CMD_IOTRACE
	bool "iotrace - Support for tracing I/O activity"
	help
	  Provides an 'iotrace' command which supports recording I/O reads and
	  writes in a trace buffer in memory . It also maintains a checksum
	  of the trace records (even if space is exhausted) so that the
	  sequence of I/O accesses can be verified.

	  When debugging drivers it is useful to see what I/O accesses were
	  done and in what order.

	  Even if the individual accesses are of little interest it can be
	  useful to verify that the access pattern is consistent each time
	  an operation is performed. In this case a checksum can be used to
	  characterise the operation of a driver. The checksum can be compared
	  across different runs of the operation to verify that the driver is
	  working properly.

	  In particular, when performing major refactoring of the driver, where
	  the access pattern should not change, the checksum provides assurance
	  that the refactoring work has not broken the driver.

	  This works by sneaking into the io.h heder for an architecture and
	  redirecting I/O accesses through iotrace's tracing mechanism.

	  For now no commands are provided to examine the trace buffer. The
	  format is fairly simple, so 'md' is a reasonable substitute.

	  Note: The checksum feature is only useful for I/O regions where the
	  contents do not change outside of software control. Where this is not
	  suitable you can fall back to manually comparing the addresses. It
	  might be useful to enhance tracing to only checksum the accesses and
	  not the data read/written.

	  This enables the 'btrsubvol' command to list subvolumes
	  of a BTRFS filesystem. There are no special commands for
	  listing BTRFS directories or loading BTRFS files - this
	  can be done by the generic 'fs' commands (see CMD_FS_GENERIC)
	  when BTRFS is enabled (see FS_BTRFS).

config CMD_CBFS
	bool "Enable the 'cbfs' command"

	  filesystem information.

config CMD_MTDPARTS
	bool "MTD partition support"
	select MTD_DEVICE if (CMD_NAND || NAND)
	help
	  MTD partitioning tool support.
	  It is strongly encouraged to avoid using this command
	  anymore along with 'sf', 'nand', 'onenand'. One can still
	  declare the partitions in the mtdparts environment variable
	  but better use the MTD stack and the 'mtd' command instead.

config MTDIDS_DEFAULT
	string "Default MTD IDs"
	depends on MTD_PARTITIONS || CMD_MTDPARTS || CMD_NAND || CMD_FLASH
	help
	  Defines a default MTD IDs list for use with MTD partitions in the
	  Linux MTD command line partitions format.

config MTDPARTS_DEFAULT
	string "Default MTD partition scheme"
	depends on MTD_PARTITIONS || CMD_MTDPARTS || CMD_NAND || CMD_FLASH
	help
	  Defines a default MTD partitioning scheme in the Linux MTD command
	  line partitions format

config CMD_MTDPARTS_SPREAD
	bool "Padd partition size to take account of bad blocks"
	depends on CMD_MTDPARTS
	help
	  This enables the 'spread' sub-command of the mtdparts command.
	  This command will modify the existing mtdparts variable by increasing
	  the size of the partitions such that 1) each partition's net size is
	  at least as large as the size specified in the mtdparts variable and
	  2) each partition starts on a good block.

config CMD_REISER
	bool "reiser - Access to reiserfs filesystems"
	help
	  This provides two commands which operate on a resierfs filesystem,
	  commonly used some years ago:

	    reiserls - list files
	    reiserload - load a file

config CMD_YAFFS2
	bool "yaffs2 - Access of YAFFS2 filesystem"
	depends on YAFFS2
	default y
	help
	  This provides commands for accessing a YAFFS2 filesystem. Yet
	  Another Flash Filesystem 2 is a filesystem designed specifically
	  for NAND flash. It incorporates bad-block management and ensures
	  that device writes are sequential regardless of filesystem
	  activity.

config CMD_ZFS
	bool "zfs - Access of ZFS filesystem"
	help
	  This provides commands to accessing a ZFS filesystem, commonly used
	  on Solaris systems. Two sub-commands are provided:

	    zfsls - list files in a directory
	    zfsload - load a file

	  See doc/README.zfs for more details.

	  The bedbug (emBEDded deBUGger) command provides debugging features
	  for some PowerPC processors. For details please see the
	  docuemntation in doc/README.beddbug

config CMD_DIAG
	bool "diag - Board diagnostics"
	help
	  This command provides access to board diagnostic tests. These are
	  called Power-on Self Tests (POST). The command allows listing of
	  available tests and running either all the tests, or specific tests
	  identified by name.

config CMD_IRQ
	bool "irq - Show information about interrupts"
	depends on !ARM && !MIPS && !SH

config CMD_KGDB
	bool "kgdb - Allow debugging of U-Boot with gdb"
	depends on PPC

config CMD_TRACE
	bool "trace - Support tracing of function calls and timing"
	help
	  Enables a command to control using of function tracing within
	  U-Boot. This allows recording of call traces including timing

	  details.

config CMD_AVB
	bool "avb - Android Verified Boot 2.0 operations"

	select MTD_UBI
	help
	  UBI is a software layer above MTD layer which admits use of LVM-like
	  logical volumes on top of MTD devices, hides some complexities of
	  flash chips like wear and bad blocks and provides some other useful
	  capabilities. Please, consult the MTD web site for more details
	  (www.linux-mtd.infradead.org). Activate this option if you want
	  to use U-Boot UBI commands.
	  It is also strongly encouraged to also enable CONFIG_MTD to get full
	  partition support.
