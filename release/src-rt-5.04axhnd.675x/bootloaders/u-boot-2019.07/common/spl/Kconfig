config SPL_STACK_R
	bool "Enable SDRAM location for SPL stack"

	  function, it is possible for the stack to move there before
	  board_init_r() is reached. This option enables a special SDRAM
	  location for the SPL stack. U-Boot SPL switches to this after

	  SRAM which is limited to SYS_MALLOC_F_LEN bytes.

config SPL_SEPARATE_BSS
	bool "BSS section is in a different memory region from text"
	help
	  Some platforms need a large BSS region in SPL and can provide this
	  because RAM is already set up. In this case BSS can be moved to RAM.
	  This option should then be enabled so that the correct device tree
	  location is used. Normally we put the device tree at the end of BSS
	  but with this option enabled, it goes at _image_binary_end.

config SPL_BANNER_PRINT
	bool "Enable output of the SPL banner 'U-Boot SPL ...'"

	  Enable this to support CRC32 in uImages or FIT images within SPL.
	  This is a 32-bit checksum value that can be used to verify images.
	  For FIT images, this is the least secure type of checksum, suitable
	  for detected accidental image corruption. For secure applications you
	  should consider SHA1 or SHA256.

config SPL_MD5_SUPPORT
	bool "Support MD5"
	depends on SPL_FIT
	help
	  Enable this to support MD5 in FIT images within SPL. An MD5
	  checksum is a 128-bit hash value used to check that the image
	  contents have not been corrupted. Note that MD5 is not considered
	  secure as it is possible (with a brute-force attack) to adjust the
	  image while still retaining the same MD5 hash value. For secure
	  applications where images may be changed maliciously, you should
	  consider SHA1 or SHA256.

config SPL_SHA1_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SHA1"
	depends on SPL_FIT
	select SHA1
	help
	  Enable this to support SHA1 in FIT images within SPL. A SHA1
	  checksum is a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value used to check that the
	  image contents have not been corrupted or maliciously altered.
	  While SHA1 is fairly secure it is coming to the end of its life
	  due to the expanding computing power available to brute-force
	  attacks. For more security, consider SHA256.

config SPL_SHA256_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SHA256"
	depends on SPL_FIT
	select SHA256
	help
	  Enable this to support SHA256 in FIT images within SPL. A SHA256
	  checksum is a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value used to check that the
	  image contents have not been corrupted. SHA256 is recommended for
	  use in secure applications since (as at 2016) there is no known
	  feasible attack that could produce a 'collision' with differing
	  input data. Use this for the highest security. Note that only the
	  SHA256 variant is supported: SHA512 and others are not currently
	  supported in U-Boot.

	default y if ARCH_IMX8M
	help
	  Enable this to reduce the size of the FIT image loading code
	  in SPL, if space for the SPL binary is very tight.

	  This removes the detection of image types (which forces the
	  first image to be treated as having a U-Boot style calling
	  convention) and skips the recording of each loaded payload
	  (i.e. loadable) into the FDT (modifying the loaded FDT to
	  ensure this information is available to the next image
	  invoked).

config SPL_CPU_SUPPORT
	bool "Support CPU drivers"
	help
	  Enable this to support CPU drivers in SPL. These drivers can set
	  up CPUs and provide information about them such as the model and

	  may improve boot performance. Enable this option to build the
	  drivers in drivers/cpu as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_CRYPTO_SUPPORT
	bool "Support crypto drivers"
	help
	  Enable crypto drivers in SPL. These drivers can be used to

config SPL_DMA_SUPPORT
	bool "Support DMA drivers"
	help
	  Enable DMA (direct-memory-access) drivers in SPL. These drivers

	  build, for those that support building in SPL (not all drivers do).

config SPL_ENV_SUPPORT
	bool "Support an environment"
	help
	  Enable environment support in SPL. The U-Boot environment provides
	  a number of settings (essentially name/value pairs) which can
	  control many aspects of U-Boot's operation. Normally this is not
	  needed in SPL as it has a much simpler task with less
	  configuration. But some boards use this to support 'Falcon' boot
	  on EXT2 and FAT, where SPL boots directly into Linux without
	  starting U-Boot first. Enabling this option will make env_get()
	  and env_set() available in SPL.

config SPL_SAVEENV
	bool "Support save environment"
	depends on SPL_ENV_SUPPORT
	select SPL_MMC_WRITE if ENV_IS_IN_MMC
	help
	  Enable save environment support in SPL after setenv. By default
	  the saveenv option is not provided in SPL, but some boards need
	  this support in 'Falcon' boot, where SPL need to boot from
	  different images based on environment variable set by OS. For
	  example OS may set "reboot_image" environment variable to
	  "recovery" inorder to boot recovery image by SPL. The SPL read
	  "reboot_image" and act accordingly and change the reboot_image
	  to default mode using setenv and save the environment.

config SPL_ETH_SUPPORT
	bool "Support Ethernet"
	depends on SPL_ENV_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable access to the network subsystem and associated Ethernet
	  drivers in SPL. This permits SPL to load U-Boot over an Ethernet
	  link rather than from an on-board peripheral. Environment support
	  is required since the network stack uses a number of environment
	  variables. See also SPL_NET_SUPPORT.

config SPL_FS_EXT4
	bool "Support EXT filesystems"
	help
	  Enable support for EXT2/3/4 filesystems with SPL. This permits
	  U-Boot (or Linux in Falcon mode) to be loaded from an EXT
	  filesystem from within SPL. Support for the underlying block
	  device (e.g. MMC or USB) must be enabled separately.

config SPL_FS_FAT
	bool "Support FAT filesystems"
	select FS_FAT
	help
	  Enable support for FAT and VFAT filesystems with SPL. This
	  permits U-Boot (or Linux in Falcon mode) to be loaded from a FAT
	  filesystem from within SPL. Support for the underlying block
	  device (e.g. MMC or USB) must be enabled separately.

config SPL_FAT_WRITE
	bool "Support write for FAT filesystems"

	  enabled separately.

config SPL_FPGA_SUPPORT
	bool "Support FPGAs"
	help
	  Enable support for FPGAs in SPL. Field-programmable Gate Arrays
	  provide software-configurable hardware which is typically used to
	  implement peripherals (such as UARTs, LCD displays, MMC) or
	  accelerate custom processing functions, such as image processing
	  or machine learning. Sometimes it is useful to program the FPGA
	  as early as possible during boot, and this option can enable that
	  within SPL.

config SPL_GPIO_SUPPORT
	bool "Support GPIO in SPL"
	help
	  Enable support for GPIOs (General-purpose Input/Output) in SPL.
	  GPIOs allow U-Boot to read the state of an input line (high or
	  low) and set the state of an output line. This can be used to
	  drive LEDs, control power to various system parts and read user
	  input. GPIOs can be useful in SPL to enable a 'sign-of-life' LED,
	  for example. Enable this option to build the drivers in
	  drivers/gpio as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_I2C_SUPPORT
	bool "Support I2C"
	help
	  Enable support for the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus in SPL.
	  I2C works with a clock and data line which can be driven by a
	  one or more masters or slaves. It is a fairly complex bus but is
	  widely used as it only needs two lines for communication. Speeds of
	  400kbps are typical but up to 3.4Mbps is supported by some
	  hardware. I2C can be useful in SPL to configure power management
	  ICs (PMICs) before raising the CPU clock speed, for example.
	  Enable this option to build the drivers in drivers/i2c as part of
	  an SPL build.

config SPL_LIBCOMMON_SUPPORT
	bool "Support common libraries"
	help
	  Enable support for common U-Boot libraries within SPL. These

	  boards. Enable this option to build the code in common/ as part of
	  an SPL build.

config SPL_LIBDISK_SUPPORT
	bool "Support disk partitions"
	select PARTITIONS
	help
	  Enable support for disk partitions within SPL. 'Disk' is something
	  of a misnomer as it includes non-spinning media such as flash (as
	  used in MMC and USB sticks). Partitions provide a way for a disk
	  to be split up into separate regions, with a partition table placed
	  at the start or end which describes the location and size of each
	  'partition'. These partitions are typically uses as individual block
	  devices, typically with an EXT2 or FAT filesystem in each. This
	  option enables whatever partition support has been enabled in
	  U-Boot to also be used in SPL. It brings in the code in disk/.

config SPL_LIBGENERIC_SUPPORT
	bool "Support generic libraries"
	help
	  Enable support for generic U-Boot libraries within SPL. These
	  libraries include generic code to deal with device tree, hashing,

	  where it can run.

config SPL_MTD_SUPPORT
	bool "Support MTD drivers"
	help
	  Enable support for MTD (Memory Technology Device) within SPL. MTD
	  provides a block interface over raw NAND and can also be used with
	  SPI flash. This allows SPL to load U-Boot from supported MTD
	  devices. See SPL_NAND_SUPPORT and SPL_ONENAND_SUPPORT for how
	  to enable specific MTD drivers.

config SPL_MUSB_NEW_SUPPORT

	  build.

config SPL_NET_SUPPORT
	bool "Support networking"
	help
	  Enable support for network devices (such as Ethernet) in SPL.
	  This permits SPL to load U-Boot over a network link rather than
