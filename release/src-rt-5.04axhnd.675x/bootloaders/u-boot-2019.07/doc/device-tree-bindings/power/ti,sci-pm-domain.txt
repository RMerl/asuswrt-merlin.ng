Texas Instruments TI SCI Generic Power Domain
=============================================

Some TI SoCs contain a system controller (like the SYSFW, etc...) that is
responsible for controlling the state of the IPs that are present.
Communication between the host processor running an OS and the system
controller happens through a protocol known as TI SCI [1].

PM Domain Node
==============
The PM domain node represents the global PM domain managed by the SYSFW. Because
this relies on the TI SCI protocol to communicate with the SYSFW it must be a
child of the sysfw node.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible: Must be "ti,sci-pm-domain"
- #power-domain-cells: Must be 1 so that an id can be provided in each
		       device node.

Example (AM65x):
----------------
	sysfw: sysfw {
		compatible = "ti,am654-system-controller";
		...
		k3_pds: power-controller {
			compatible = "ti,sci-pm-domain";
			#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

PM Domain Consumers
===================
Hardware blocks belonging to a PM domain should contain a "power-domains"
property that is a phandle pointing to the corresponding PM domain node
along with an index representing the device id to be passed to the PMMC
for device control.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- power-domains: phandle pointing to the corresponding PM domain node
		 and an ID representing the device.

Example (AM65x):
----------------
	uart2: serial@02800000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-uart";
		...
		power-domains = <&k3_pds 0x3f>;
	};
