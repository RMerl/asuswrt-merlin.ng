	  Enable checking for exceeding the boot count limit.

config BOOTCOUNT_GENERIC
	bool "Generic default boot counter"
	help
	  Generic bootcount stored at SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR.

	  SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR:
	    Set to the address where the bootcount and bootcount magic
	    will be stored.

config BOOTCOUNT_EXT
	bool "Boot counter on EXT filesystem"
	help
	  Add support for maintaining boot count in a file on an EXT
	  filesystem.

	select SPL_AM33XX_ENABLE_RTC32K_OSC if AM33XX
	help
	  A bootcount driver for the RTC IP block found on many TI platforms.
	  This requires the RTC clocks, etc, to be enabled prior to use and
	  not all boards with this IP block on it will have the RTC in use.

config BOOTCOUNT_ENV
	bool "Boot counter in environment"
	help
	  If no softreset save registers are found on the hardware
	  "bootcount" is stored in the environment. To prevent a
	  saveenv on all reboots, the environment variable
	  "upgrade_available" is used. If "upgrade_available" is
	  0, "bootcount" is always 0, if "upgrade_available" is
	  1 "bootcount" is incremented in the environment.
	  So the Userspace Application must set the "upgrade_available"
	  and "bootcount" variable to 0, if a boot was successfully.

config BOOTCOUNT_RAM
	bool "Boot counter in RAM"
	help
	  Store the bootcount in DRAM protected against against bit errors
	  due to short power loss or holding a system in RESET.

config BOOTCOUNT_I2C

	  Enable support for the bootcounter on an i2c (like RTC) device.

	  CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR = i2c addr which is used for
	                              the bootcounter.

config DM_BOOTCOUNT
        bool "Boot counter in a device-model device"
	help
	  Enables reading/writing the bootcount in a device-model based
	  backing store.  If an entry in /chosen/u-boot,bootcount-device
	  exists, this will be the preferred bootcount device; otherwise
	  the first available bootcount device will be used.

	help
	  Enabled reading/writing the bootcount in a DM RTC device.
	  The wrapper device is to be specified with the compatible string
	  'u-boot,bootcount-rtc' and the 'rtc'-property (a phandle pointing
	  to the underlying RTC device) and an optional 'offset' property
	  are supported.

	  Accesses to the backing store are performed using the write16
	  and read16 ops of DM RTC devices.
