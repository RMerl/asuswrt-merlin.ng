config DMA
	bool "Enable Driver Model for DMA drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for DMA. DMA engines can do
	  asynchronous data transfers without involving the host
	  CPU. Currently, this framework can be used to offload
	  memory copies to and from devices like qspi, ethernet
	  etc Drivers provide methods to access the DMA devices
	  buses that is used to transfer data to and from memory.
	  The uclass interface is defined in include/dma.h.

config DMA_CHANNELS
	bool "Enable DMA channels support"
	depends on DMA
	help
	  Enable channels support for DMA. Some DMA controllers have multiple
	  channels which can either transfer data to/from different devices.

config SANDBOX_DMA
	bool "Enable the sandbox DMA test driver"
	depends on DMA && DMA_CHANNELS && SANDBOX
	help
	  Enable support for a test DMA uclass implementation. It stimulates
	  DMA transfer by simple copying data between channels.

config BCM6348_IUDMA
	bool "BCM6348 IUDMA driver"
	depends on ARCH_BMIPS
	select DMA_CHANNELS
	help
	  Enable the BCM6348 IUDMA driver.
	  This driver support data transfer from devices to
	  memory and from memory to devices.

config TI_EDMA3
	bool "TI EDMA3 driver"
	help
	  Enable the TI EDMA3 driver for DRA7xx and AM43xx evms.
	  This driver support data transfer between memory
	  regions.

config APBH_DMA
	bool "Support APBH DMA"
	depends on MX23 || MX28 || MX6 || MX7
	help
	  Enable APBH DMA driver.
