	bool "Enable Driver Model for GPIO drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for GPIO access. The standard GPIO
	  interface (gpio_get_value(), etc.) is then implemented by
	  the GPIO uclass. Drivers provide methods to query the
	  particular GPIOs that they provide. The uclass interface
	  is defined in include/asm-generic/gpio.h.

config ALTERA_PIO
	bool "Altera PIO driver"
	depends on DM_GPIO

	  for each bank.

config SANDBOX_GPIO
	bool "Enable sandbox GPIO driver"
	depends on SANDBOX && DM && DM_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports some simulated GPIOs which can be adjusted
	  using 'back door' functions like sandbox_gpio_set_value(). Then the
	  GPIOs can be inspected through the normal get_get_value()
	  interface. The purpose of this is to allow GPIOs to be used as
	  normal in sandbox, perhaps with test code actually driving the
	  behaviour of those GPIOs.

config MPC8XXX_GPIO
	bool "Freescale MPC8XXX GPIO driver"
	depends on DM_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports the built-in GPIO controller of MPC8XXX CPUs.

	  i.e.

	  gpio-controller@fc00 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "fsl,pq3-gpio";
		reg = <0xfc00 0x100>
	  }

	  By default, each bank is assumed to have 32 GPIOs, but the ngpios
	  setting is honored, so the number of GPIOs for each bank is
	  configurable to match the actual GPIO count of the SoC (e.g. the
	  32/32/23 banks of the P1022 SoC).

	  Aside from the standard functions of input/output mode, and output
	  value setting, the open-drain feature, which can configure individual
	  GPIOs to work as open-drain outputs, is supported.
