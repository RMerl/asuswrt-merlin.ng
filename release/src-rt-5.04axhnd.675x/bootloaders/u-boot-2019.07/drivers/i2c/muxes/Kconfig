config I2C_MUX
	bool "Support I2C multiplexers"
	depends on DM_I2C
	help
	  This enables I2C buses to be multiplexed, so that you can select
	  one of several buses using some sort of control mechanism. The
	  bus select is handled automatically when that bus is accessed,
	  using a suitable I2C MUX driver.

config SPL_I2C_MUX
	bool "Support I2C multiplexers on SPL"
	depends on I2C_MUX
	help
	  This enables I2C buses to be multiplexed, so that you can select
	  one of several buses using some sort of control mechanism. The
	  bus select is handled automatically when that bus is accessed,
	  using a suitable I2C MUX driver.

config I2C_ARB_GPIO_CHALLENGE
	bool "GPIO-based I2C arbitration"
	depends on I2C_MUX
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for an
	  I2C multimaster arbitration scheme using GPIOs and a challenge &
	  response mechanism where masters have to claim the bus by asserting
	  a GPIO.

config I2C_MUX_PCA954x
	tristate "TI PCA954x I2C Mux/switches"
	depends on I2C_MUX
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the TI PCA954x I2C mux/switch
	  devices. It is x width I2C multiplexer which enables to partitioning
	  I2C bus and connect multiple devices with the same address to the same
	  I2C controller where driver handles proper routing to target i2c
	  device. Supported chips are PCA9543, PCA9544, PCA9547, PCA9548 and
	  PCA9646.

config I2C_MUX_GPIO
        tristate "GPIO-based I2C multiplexer"
	depends on I2C_MUX && DM_GPIO
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for
	  a GPIO based I2C multiplexer. This driver provides access to
	  I2C busses connected through a MUX, which is controlled
	  through GPIO pins.
