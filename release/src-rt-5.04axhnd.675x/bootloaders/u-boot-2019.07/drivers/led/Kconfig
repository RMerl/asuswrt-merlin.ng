config LED
	bool "Enable LED support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Many boards have LEDs which can be used to signal status or alerts.
	  U-Boot provides a uclass API to implement this feature. LED drivers
	  can provide access to board-specific LEDs. Use of the device tree
	  for configuration is encouraged.

config LED_BCM6328
	bool "LED Support for BCM6328"
	depends on LED && ARCH_BMIPS
	help
	  This option enables support for LEDs connected to the BCM6328
	  LED HW controller accessed via MMIO registers.
	  HW blinking is supported and up to 24 LEDs can be controlled.
	  All LEDs can blink at the same time but the delay is shared, which
	  means that if one LED is set to blink at 100ms and then a different
	  LED is set to blink at 200ms, both will blink at 200ms.

config LED_BCM6358
	bool "LED Support for BCM6358"
	depends on LED && ARCH_BMIPS
	help
	  This option enables support for LEDs connected to the BCM6358
	  LED HW controller accessed via MMIO registers.
	  HW has no blinking capabilities and up to 32 LEDs can be controlled.

config LED_BCM6858
	bool "LED Support for BCM6858"
	depends on LED && (ARCH_BCM6858 || ARCH_BCM63158)
	help
	  This option enables support for LEDs connected to the BCM6858
	  HW has blinking capabilities and up to 32 LEDs can be controlled.

config LED_BLINK
	bool "Support LED blinking"
	depends on LED
	help
	  Some drivers can support automatic blinking of LEDs with a given
	  period, without needing timers or extra code to handle the timing.
	  This option enables support for this which adds slightly to the
	  code size.

config SPL_LED
	bool "Enable LED support in SPL"
	depends on SPL && SPL_DM
	help
	  The LED subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use LEDs in SPL,
	  enable this option. You will need to enable device tree in SPL
	  for this to work.

config LED_GPIO
	bool "LED support for GPIO-connected LEDs"
	depends on LED && DM_GPIO
	help
	  Enable support for LEDs which are connected to GPIO lines. These
	  GPIOs may be on the SoC or some other device which provides GPIOs.
	  The GPIO driver must used driver model. LEDs are configured using
	  the device tree.

config SPL_LED_GPIO
	bool "LED support for GPIO-connected LEDs in SPL"
        depends on SPL_LED && DM_GPIO
	help
	  This option is an SPL-variant of the LED_GPIO option.
	  See the help of LED_GPIO for details.

config BCM_BCA_LED
	bool "LED Support for BCMBCA devices"
	depends on LED && ARCH_BCMBCA
	help
	  This option enables support for LEDs connected to the all BCMBCA based devices
	  HW has blinking capabilities and up to 32 LEDs can be controlled.

config LED_STATUS
	bool "Enable status LED API"
	help
	  Allows common u-boot commands to use a board's leds to
	  provide status for activities like booting and downloading files.
