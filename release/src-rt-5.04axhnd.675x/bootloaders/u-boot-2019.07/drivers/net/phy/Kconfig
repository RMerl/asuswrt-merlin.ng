	  Force master mode for 1000BASE-T on RTl8211x PHYs (except for RTL8211F).
	  This can work around link stability and data corruption issues on gigabit
	  links which can occur in slave mode on certain PHYs, e.g. on the
	  RTL8211C(L).

	  Please note that two directly connected devices (i.e. via crossover cable)
	  will not be able to establish a link between each other if they both force
	  master mode. Multiple devices forcing master mode when connected by a
	  network switch do not pose a problem as the switch configures its affected
	  ports into slave mode.

	  This option only affects gigabit links. If you must establish a direct
	  connection between two devices which both force master mode, try forcing
	  the link speed to 100MBit/s.

	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  The IEEE 802.3az-2010 (EEE) standard provides a protocol to coordinate
	  transitions to/from a lower power consumption level (Low Power Idle
	  mode) based on link utilization. When no packets are being
	  transmitted, the system goes to Low Power Idle mode to save power.

	  Under particular circumstances this setting can cause issues where
	  the PHY is unable to transmit or receive any packet when in LPI mode.
	  The problem is caused when the PHY is configured to stop receiving
	  the xMII clock while it is signaling LPI. For some PHYs the bit
	  configuring this behavior is set by the Linux kernel, causing the
	  issue in U-Boot on reboot if the PHY retains the register value.

	  Default n, which means that the PHY state is not changed. To work
	  around the issues, change this setting to y.
