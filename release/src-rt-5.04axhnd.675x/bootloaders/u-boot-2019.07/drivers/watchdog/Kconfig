config WATCHDOG
	bool "Enable U-Boot watchdog reset"
	help
	  This option enables U-Boot watchdog support where U-Boot is using
	  watchdog_reset function to service watchdog device in U-Boot. Enable
	  this option if you want to service enabled watchdog by U-Boot. Disable
	  this option if you want U-Boot to start watchdog but never service it.

config WDT
	bool "Enable driver model for watchdog timer drivers"
	depends on DM
	imply WATCHDOG
	help
	  Enable driver model for watchdog timer. At the moment the API
	  is very simple and only supports four operations:
	  start, stop, reset and expire_now (expire immediately).
	  What exactly happens when the timer expires is up to a particular
	  device/driver.

	   Marvell Armada chips.

config WDT_SANDBOX
	bool "Enable Watchdog Timer support for Sandbox"
	depends on SANDBOX && WDT
	help
	  Enable Watchdog Timer support in Sandbox. This is a dummy device that
	  can be probed and supports all of the methods of WDT, but does not
	  really do anything.
