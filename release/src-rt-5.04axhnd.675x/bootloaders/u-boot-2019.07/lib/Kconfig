	  Sets the size of the trace buffer in U-Boot. This is allocated from
	  memory during relocation. If this buffer is too small, the trace
	  history will be truncated, with later records omitted.

	  If early trace is enabled (i.e. before relocation), this buffer must
	  be large enough to include all the data from the early trace buffer as
	  well, since this is copied over to the main buffer during relocation.

	  A trace record is emitted for each function call and each record is

	depends on TRACE
	help
	  Sometimes it is helpful to trace execution of U-Boot before
