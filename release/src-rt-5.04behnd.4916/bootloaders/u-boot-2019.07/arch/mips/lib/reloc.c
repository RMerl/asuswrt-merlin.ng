 * MIPS Relocation

 * Copyright (c) 2017 Imagination Technologies Ltd.
 *
 * Relocation data, found in the .rel section, is generated by the mips-relocs
 * tool & contains a record of all locations in the U-Boot binary that need to
 * be fixed up during relocation.
 *
 * The data is a sequence of unsigned integers, which are of somewhat arbitrary
 * size. This is achieved by encoding integers as a sequence of bytes, each of
 * which contains 7 bits of data with the most significant bit indicating
 * whether any further bytes need to be read. The least significant bits of the
 * integer are found in the first byte - ie. it somewhat resembles little
 * endian.
 *
 * Each pair of two integers represents a relocation that must be applied. The
 * first integer represents the type of relocation as a standard ELF relocation
 * type (ie. R_MIPS_*). The second integer represents the offset at which to
 * apply the relocation, relative to the previous relocation or for the first
 * relocation the start of the relocated .text section.
 *
 * The end of the relocation data is indicated when type R_MIPS_NONE (0) is
 * read, at which point no further integers should be read. That is, the
 * terminating R_MIPS_NONE reloc includes no offset.
