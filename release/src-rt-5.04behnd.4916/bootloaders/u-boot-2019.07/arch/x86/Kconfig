	  runs directly from the reset vector (via 16-bit start-up).

	  Alternatively it can be run as a 64-bit binary, thus requiring a
	  64-bit machine. In this case SPL runs in 32-bit mode (via 16-bit
	  start-up) then jumps to U-Boot in 64-bit mode.

	  anywhere. Before it is set up, it is possible to access PCI
	  configuration space through I/O access, but memory access is more
	  convenient. Using this, PCI can be scanned and configured. This
	  should be set to a region that does not conflict with memory
	  assigned to PCI devices - i.e. the memory and prefetch regions, as
	  passed to pci_set_region().

config PCIE_ECAM_SIZE
	hex
	default 0x10000000
	help
	  This is the size of memory-mapped address of PCI configuration space,
	  which is only available through the Enhanced Configuration Access
	  Mechanism (ECAM) with PCI Express. Each bus consumes 1 MiB memory,
	  so a default 0x10000000 size covers all of the 256 buses which is the
	  maximum number of PCI buses as defined by the PCI specification.

config I8259_PIC
	bool "Enable Intel 8259 compatible interrupt controller"
	default y
	help
	  Intel 8259 ISA compatible chipset incorporates two 8259 (master and
	  slave) interrupt controllers. Include this to have U-Boot set up
	  the interrupt correctly.

config APIC
	bool "Enable Intel Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller"
	default y
	help
	  The (A)dvanced (P)rogrammable (I)nterrupt (C)ontroller is responsible
	  for catching interrupts and distributing them to one or more CPU
	  cores. In most cases there are some LAPICs (local) for each core and
	  one I/O APIC. This conjunction is found on most modern x86 systems.

config PINCTRL_ICH6
	bool
	help
	  Intel ICH6 compatible chipset pinctrl driver. It needs to work
	  together with the ICH6 compatible gpio driver.

config I8254_TIMER
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Intel 8254 timer contains three counters which have fixed uses.
	  Include this to have U-Boot set up the timer correctly.

config SEABIOS
	bool "Support booting SeaBIOS"
	help
	  SeaBIOS is an open source implementation of a 16-bit X86 BIOS.
	  It can run in an emulator or natively on X86 hardware with the use
	  of coreboot/U-Boot. By turning on this option, U-Boot prepares
	  all the configuration tables that are necessary to boot SeaBIOS.

	  Check http://www.seabios.org/SeaBIOS for details.

config HIGH_TABLE_SIZE
	hex "Size of configuration tables which reside in high memory"
	default 0x10000
	depends on SEABIOS
	help
	  SeaBIOS itself resides in E seg and F seg, where U-Boot puts all
	  configuration tables like PIRQ/MP/ACPI. To avoid conflicts, U-Boot
	  puts a copy of configuration tables in high memory region which
	  is reserved on the stack before relocation. The region size is
	  determined by this option.

	  Increse it if the default size does not fit the board's needs.
	  This is most likely due to a large ACPI DSDT table is used.
