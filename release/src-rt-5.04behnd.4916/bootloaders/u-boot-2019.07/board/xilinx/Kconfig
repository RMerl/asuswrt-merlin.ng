	  On Zynq and ZynqMP U-Boot SPL (or U-Boot proper if
	  ZYNQMP_PSU_INIT_ENABLED is set) is responsible for some
	  basic initializations, such as enabling peripherals and
	  configuring pinmuxes. The PS init file (called
	  psu_init_gpl.c on ZynqMP, ps7_init_gpl.c for Zynq-7000)
	  contains the code for such initializations.

	  U-Boot contains PS init files for some boards, but each of
	  them describes only one specific configuration. Users of a
	  different board, or needing a different configuration, can
	  generate custom files using the Xilinx development tools.

	  There are three ways to give a PS init file to U-Boot:

	  1. Set this variable to the path, either relative to the
	     source tree or absolute, where the psu_init_gpl.c or
	     ps7_init_gpl.c file is located. U-Boot will build this
	     file.

	  2. If you leave an empty string here, U-Boot will use
	     board/xilinx/zynq/$(CONFIG_DEFAULT_DEVICE_TREE)/ps7_init_gpl.c
	     for Zynq-7000, or
	     board/xilinx/zynqmp/$(CONFIG_DEFAULT_DEVICE_TREE)/psu_init_gpl.c
	     for ZynqMP.

	  3. If the above file does not exist, U-Boot will use
	     board/xilinx/zynq/ps7_init_gpl.c for Zynq-7000, or
	     board/xilinx/zynqmp/psu_init_gpl.c for ZynqMP. This file
	     is not provided by U-Boot, you have to copy it there
	     before the build.
