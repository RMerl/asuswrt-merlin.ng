config BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Boot timing and reporting"
	help
	  Enable recording of boot time while booting. To use it, insert
	  calls to bootstage_mark() with a suitable BOOTSTAGE_ID from
	  bootstage.h. Only a single entry is recorded for each ID. You can
	  give the entry a name with bootstage_mark_name(). You can also
	  record elapsed time in a particular stage using bootstage_start()
	  before starting and bootstage_accum() when finished. Bootstage will
	  add up all the accumulated time and report it.

	  Normally, IDs are defined in bootstage.h but a small number of
	  additional 'user' IDs can be used by passing BOOTSTAGE_ID_ALLOC
	  as the ID.

	  Calls to show_boot_progress() will also result in log entries but
	  these will not have names.

config SPL_BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Boot timing and reported in SPL"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Enable recording of boot time in SPL. To make this visible to U-Boot
	  proper, enable BOOTSTAGE_STASH as well. This will stash the timing
	  information when SPL finishes and load it when U-Boot proper starts
	  up.

config TPL_BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Boot timing and reported in TPL"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Enable recording of boot time in SPL. To make this visible to U-Boot

	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Enable output of a boot time report just before the OS is booted.
	  This shows how long it took U-Boot to go through each stage of the
	  boot process. The report looks something like this:

	  Stash the bootstage information in the FDT. A root 'bootstage'
	  node is created with each bootstage id as a child. Each child
	  has a 'name' property and either 'mark' containing the
	  mark time in microseconds, or 'accum' containing the
	  accumulated time for that bootstage id in microseconds.
	  For example:

		bootstage {
			154 {
				name = "board_init_f";
				mark = <3575678>;
			};
			170 {
				name = "lcd";
				accum = <33482>;

	  Code in the Linux kernel can find this in /proc/devicetree.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH
	bool "Stash the boot timing information in memory before booting OS"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Some OSes do not support device tree. Bootstage can instead write
	  the boot timing information in a binary format at a given address.
	  This happens through a call to bootstage_stash(), typically in
	  the CPU's cleanup_before_linux() function. You can use the
	  'bootstage stash' and 'bootstage unstash' commands to do this on
	  the command line.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH_ADDR

config SILENT_CONSOLE
	bool "Support a silent console"
	help
	  This option allows the console to be silenced, meaning that no
	  output will appear on the console devices. This is controlled by
	  setting the environment variable 'silent' to a non-empty value.
	  Note this also silences the console when booting Linux.

	  When the console is set up, the variable is checked, and the
	  GD_FLG_SILENT flag is set. Changing the environment variable later
	  will update the flag.

config SILENT_U_BOOT_ONLY
	bool "Only silence the U-Boot console"
	depends on SILENT_CONSOLE
	help
	  Normally when the U-Boot console is silenced, Linux's console is
	  also silenced (assuming the board boots into Linux). This option
	  allows the linux console to operate normally, even if U-Boot's
	  is silenced.

config SILENT_CONSOLE_UPDATE_ON_SET
	bool "Changes to the 'silent' environment variable update immediately"
	depends on SILENT_CONSOLE
	default y if SILENT_CONSOLE
	help
	  When the 'silent' environment variable is changed, update the
	  console silence flag immediately. This allows 'setenv' to be used
	  to silence or un-silence the console.

	  The effect is that any change to the variable will affect the
	  GD_FLG_SILENT flag.

config SILENT_CONSOLE_UPDATE_ON_RELOC
	bool "Allow flags to take effect on relocation"
	depends on SILENT_CONSOLE
	help
	  In some cases the environment is not available until relocation

config PRE_CONSOLE_BUFFER
	bool "Buffer characters before the console is available"
	help
	  Prior to the console being initialised (i.e. serial UART
	  initialised etc) all console output is silently discarded.
	  Defining CONFIG_PRE_CONSOLE_BUFFER will cause U-Boot to
	  buffer any console messages prior to the console being
	  initialised to a buffer. The buffer is a circular buffer, so
	  if it overflows, earlier output is discarded.

	  Note that this is not currently supported in SPL. It would be
	  useful to be able to share the pre-console buffer with SPL.

config PRE_CON_BUF_SZ
	int "Sets the size of the pre-console buffer"
	depends on PRE_CONSOLE_BUFFER
	default 4096
	help
	  The size of the pre-console buffer affects how much console output
	  can be held before it overflows and starts discarding earlier
	  output. Normally there is very little output at this early stage,
	  unless debugging is enabled, so allow enough for ~10 lines of
	  text.

	  This is a useful feature if you are using a video console and
	  want to see the full boot output on the console. Without this
	  option only the post-relocation output will be displayed.

config PRE_CON_BUF_ADDR
	hex "Address of the pre-console buffer"

	default 0x2f000000 if ARCH_SUNXI && MACH_SUN9I
	default 0x4f000000 if ARCH_SUNXI && !MACH_SUN9I
	help
	  This sets the start address of the pre-console buffer. This must
	  be in available memory and is accessed before relocation and
	  possibly before DRAM is set up. Therefore choose an address
	  carefully.

	  We should consider removing this option and allocating the memory
	  in board_init_f_init_reserve() instead.

config CONSOLE_MUX
	bool "Enable console multiplexing"
	default y if DM_VIDEO || VIDEO || LCD
	help
	  This allows multiple devices to be used for each console 'file'.
	  For example, stdout can be set to go to serial and video.
	  Similarly, stdin can be set to come from serial and keyboard.
	  Input can be provided from either source. Console multiplexing
	  adds a small amount of size to U-Boot.  Changes to the environment
	  variables stdout, stdin and stderr will take effect immediately.

config SYS_CONSOLE_IS_IN_ENV
	bool "Select console devices from the environment"
	default y if CONSOLE_MUX
	help
	  This allows multiple input/output devices to be set at boot time.
	  For example, if stdout is set to "serial,video" then output will
	  be sent to both the serial and video devices on boot. The
	  environment variables can be updated after boot to change the
	  input/output devices.

config SYS_CONSOLE_OVERWRITE_ROUTINE
	bool "Allow board control over console overwriting"
	help
	  If this is enabled, and the board-specific function
	  overwrite_console() returns 1, the stdin, stderr and stdout are
	  switched to the serial port, else the settings in the environment
	  are used. If this is not enabled, the console will not be switched
	  to serial.

config SYS_CONSOLE_ENV_OVERWRITE
	bool "Update environment variables during console init"
	help
	  The console environment variables (stdout, stdin, stderr) can be
	  used to determine the correct console devices on start-up. This
	  option writes the console devices to these variables on console
	  start-up (after relocation). This causes the environment to be
	  updated to match the console devices actually chosen.

config SYS_CONSOLE_INFO_QUIET
	bool "Don't display the console devices on boot"
	help
	  Normally U-Boot displays the current settings for stdout, stdin
	  and stderr on boot when the post-relocation console is set up.
	  Enable this option to suppress this output. It can be obtained by
	  calling stdio_print_current_devices() from board code.

config SYS_STDIO_DEREGISTER
	bool "Allow deregistering stdio devices"
	default y if USB_KEYBOARD
	help
	  Generally there is no need to deregister stdio devices since they
	  are never deactivated. But if a stdio device is used which can be
	  removed (for example a USB keyboard) then this option can be
	  enabled to ensure this is handled correctly.

	  after driver model is ready in the pre-relocation init sequence.
	  Note that the normal serial console is not yet set up, but the
	  debug UART will be available if enabled.

config BOARD_EARLY_INIT_R
	bool "Call board-specific init after relocation"
	help
	  Some boards need to perform initialisation as directly after
	  relocation. With this option, U-Boot calls board_early_init_r()
	  in the post-relocation init sequence.

config LAST_STAGE_INIT
	bool "Call board-specific as last setup step"
	help
	  Some boards need to perform initialisation immediately before control
	  is passed to the command-line interpreter (e.g. for initializations
	  that depend on later phases in the init sequence). With this option,
	  U-Boot calls last_stage_init() before the command-line interpreter is
	  started.

	bool # "Support hashing API (SHA1, SHA256, etc.)"
	help
	  This provides a way to hash data in memory using various supported
	  algorithms (such as SHA1, MD5, CRC32). The API is defined in hash.h
	  and the algorithms it supports are defined in common/hash.c. See
	  also CMD_HASH for command-line access.

config AVB_VERIFY

	depends on LIBAVB && FASTBOOT
	depends on PARTITION_UUIDS
	help
	  This option enables compilation of bootloader-dependent operations,
	  used by Android Verified Boot 2.0 library (libavb). Includes:
	    * Helpers to process strings in order to build OS bootargs.
	    * Helpers to access MMC, similar to drivers/fastboot/fb_mmc.c.
	    * Helpers to alloc/init/free avb ops.

config BLOBLIST
	bool "Support for a bloblist"
	help
	  This enables support for a bloblist in U-Boot, which can be passed
	  from TPL to SPL to U-Boot proper (and potentially to Linux). The
	  blob list supports multiple binary blobs of data, each with a tag,
	  so that different U-Boot components can store data which can survive
	  through to the next stage of the boot.

config SPL_BLOBLIST
	bool "Support for a bloblist in SPL"
	depends on BLOBLIST
	default y if SPL
	help
	  This enables a bloblist in SPL. If this is the first part of U-Boot
	  to run, then the bloblist is set up in SPL and passed to U-Boot
	  proper. If TPL also has a bloblist, then SPL uses the one from there.

config TPL_BLOBLIST
	bool "Support for a bloblist in TPL"
	depends on BLOBLIST
	default y if TPL
	help
	  This enables a bloblist in TPL. The bloblist is set up in TPL and
	  passed to SPL and U-Boot proper.

config BLOBLIST_SIZE
	hex "Size of bloblist"
	depends on BLOBLIST
	default 0x400
	help
	  Sets the size of the bloblist in bytes. This must include all
	  overhead (alignment, bloblist header, record header). The bloblist
	  is set up in the first part of U-Boot to run (TPL, SPL or U-Boot
	  proper), and this sane bloblist is used for subsequent stages.

config BLOBLIST_ADDR
	hex "Address of bloblist"
	depends on BLOBLIST
	default 0xe000 if SANDBOX
	help
	  Sets the address of the bloblist, set up by the first part of U-Boot
	  which runs. Subsequent U-Boot stages typically use the same address.
