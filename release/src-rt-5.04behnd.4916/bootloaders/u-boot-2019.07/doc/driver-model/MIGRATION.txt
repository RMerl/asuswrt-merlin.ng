Migration Schedule
====================

U-Boot has been migrating to a new driver model since its introduction in
2014. This file describes the schedule for deprecation of pre-driver-model
features.

CONFIG_DM_MMC
-------------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.04

The subsystem itself has been converted and maintainers should submit patches
switching over to using CONFIG_DM_MMC and other base driver model options in
time for inclusion in the 2019.04 rerelease.

CONFIG_DM_USB
-------------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.07

The subsystem itself has been converted along with many of the host controller
and maintainers should submit patches switching over to using CONFIG_DM_USB and
other base driver model options in time for inclusion in the 2019.07 rerelease.

CONFIG_SATA
-----------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.07

The subsystem itself has been converted along with many of the host controller
and maintainers should submit patches switching over to using CONFIG_AHCI and
other base driver model options in time for inclusion in the 2019.07 rerelease.

CONFIG_BLK
----------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.07

In concert with maintainers migrating their block device usage to the
appropriate DM driver, CONFIG_BLK needs to be set as well.  The final deadline
here coincides with the final deadline for migration of the various block
subsystems.  At this point we will be able to audit and correct the logic in
Kconfig around using CONFIG_PARTITIONS and CONFIG_HAVE_BLOCK_DEVICE and make
use of CONFIG_BLK / CONFIG_SPL_BLK as needed.

CONFIG_DM_SPI
CONFIG_DM_SPI_FLASH
-------------------

Board Maintainers should submit the patches for enabling DM_SPI and DM_SPI_FLASH
to move the migration with in the deadline.

CONFIG_DM_PCI
-------------
Deadline: 2019.07

The PCI subsystem has supported driver model since mid 2015. Maintainers should
submit patches switching over to using CONFIG_DM_PCI and other base driver
model options in time for inclusion in the 2019.07 release.


CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
---------------
Deadline: 2019.07

The video subsystem has supported driver model since early 2016. Maintainers
should submit patches switching over to using CONFIG_DM_VIDEO and other base
driver model options in time for inclusion in the 2019.07 release.
