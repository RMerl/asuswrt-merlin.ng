config DM_I2C
	bool "Enable Driver Model for I2C drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for I2C. The I2C uclass interface: probe, read,
	  write and speed, is implemented with the bus drivers operations,
	  which provide methods for bus setting and data transfer. Each chip
	  device (bus child) info is kept as parent platdata. The interface
	  is defined in include/i2c.h. When i2c bus driver supports the i2c
	  uclass, but the device drivers not, then DM_I2C_COMPAT config can
	  be used as compatibility layer.

config DM_I2C_COMPAT
	bool "Enable I2C compatibility layer"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable old-style I2C functions for compatibility with existing code.
	  This option can be enabled as a temporary measure to avoid needing
	  to convert all code for a board in a single commit. It should not
	  be enabled for any board in an official release.

config I2C_CROS_EC_TUNNEL
	tristate "Chrome OS EC tunnel I2C bus"
	depends on CROS_EC
	help
	  This provides an I2C bus that will tunnel i2c commands through to
	  the other side of the Chrome OS EC to the I2C bus connected there.
	  This will work whatever the interface used to talk to the EC (SPI,
	  I2C or LPC). Some Chromebooks use this when the hardware design
	  does not allow direct access to the main PMIC from the AP.

config I2C_CROS_EC_LDO
	bool "Provide access to LDOs on the Chrome OS EC"
	depends on CROS_EC
	---help---
	On many Chromebooks the main PMIC is inaccessible to the AP. This is
	often dealt with by using an I2C pass-through interface provided by
	the EC. On some unfortunate models (e.g. Spring) the pass-through
	is not available, and an LDO message is available instead. This
	option enables a driver which provides very basic access to those
	regulators, via the EC. We implement this as an I2C bus	which
	emulates just the TPS65090 messages we know about. This is done to
	avoid duplicating the logic in the TPS65090 regulator driver for
	enabling/disabling an LDO.

config I2C_SET_DEFAULT_BUS_NUM
	bool "Set default I2C bus number"
	depends on DM_I2C
	help
	  Set default number of I2C bus to be accessed. This option provides
	  behaviour similar to old (i.e. pre DM) I2C bus driver.

config I2C_DEFAULT_BUS_NUMBER
	hex "I2C default bus number"
	depends on I2C_SET_DEFAULT_BUS_NUM
	default 0x0
	help
	  Number of default I2C bus to use

config DM_I2C_GPIO
	bool "Enable Driver Model for software emulated I2C bus driver"
	depends on DM_I2C && DM_GPIO
	help
	  Enable the i2c bus driver emulation by using the GPIOs. The bus GPIO
	  configuration is given by the device tree. Kernel-style device tree
	  bindings are supported.
	  Binding info: doc/device-tree-bindings/i2c/i2c-gpio.txt

config SYS_I2C_AT91
	bool "Atmel I2C driver"
	depends on DM_I2C && ARCH_AT91
	help
	  Add support for the Atmel I2C driver. A serious problem is that there
	  is no documented way to issue repeated START conditions for more than
	  two messages, as needed to support combined I2C messages. Use the
	  i2c-gpio driver unless your system can cope with this limitation.
	  Binding info: doc/device-tree-bindings/i2c/i2c-at91.txt

config SYS_I2C_FSL
       bool "Freescale I2C bus driver"
       depends on DM_I2C
       help
	  Add support for Freescale I2C busses as used on MPC8240, MPC8245, and
	  MPC85xx processors.

config SYS_I2C_DW
	bool "Designware I2C Controller"
	default n
	help
	  Say yes here to select the Designware I2C Host Controller. This
	  controller is used in various SoCs, e.g. the ST SPEAr, Altera
	  SoCFPGA, Synopsys ARC700 and some Intel x86 SoCs.

	bool "DW I2C Enable Status Register not supported"

		TARGET_SPEAR320 || TARGET_SPEAR600 || TARGET_X600)
	default y
	help
	  Some versions of the Designware I2C controller do not support the
	  enable status register. This config option can be enabled in such
	  cases.

config SYS_I2C_ASPEED
	bool "Aspeed I2C Controller"
	depends on DM_I2C && ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Say yes here to select Aspeed I2C Host Controller. The driver
	  supports AST2500 and AST2400 controllers, but is very limited.
	  Only single master mode is supported and only byte-by-byte
	  synchronous reads and writes are supported, no Pool Buffers or DMA.

config SYS_I2C_INTEL
	bool "Intel I2C/SMBUS driver"
	depends on DM_I2C
	help
	  Add support for the Intel SMBUS driver. So far this driver is just
	  a stub which perhaps some basic init. There is no implementation of
	  the I2C API meaning that any I2C operations will immediately fail
	  for now.

config SYS_I2C_IMX_LPI2C
	bool "NXP i.MX LPI2C driver"
	help
	  Add support for the NXP i.MX LPI2C driver.

config SYS_I2C_MESON
	bool "Amlogic Meson I2C driver"
	depends on DM_I2C && ARCH_MESON
	help
	  Add support for the I2C controller available in Amlogic Meson
	  SoCs. The controller supports programmable bus speed including
	  standard (100kbits/s) and fast (400kbit/s) speed and allows the
	  software to define a flexible format of the bit streams. It has an
	  internal buffer holding up to 8 bytes for transfers and supports
	  both 7-bit and 10-bit addresses.

config SYS_I2C_MXC
	bool "NXP MXC I2C driver"
	help
	  Add support for the NXP I2C driver. This supports up to four bus
	  channels and operating on standard mode up to 100 kbits/s and fast
	  mode up to 400 kbits/s.
