config PMIC_CHILDREN
	bool "Allow child devices for PMICs"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	default y
	---help---
	This allows PMICs to support child devices (such as regulators) in
	SPL. This adds quite a bit of code so if you are not using this
	feature you can turn it off. Most likely you should turn it on for
	U-Boot proper.

config SPL_PMIC_CHILDREN
	bool "Allow child devices for PMICs in SPL"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	default y
	---help---
	This allows PMICs to support child devices (such as regulators) in
	SPL. This adds quite a bit of code so if you are not using this
	feature you can turn it off. In this case you may need a 'back door'
	to call your regulator code (e.g. see rk8xx.c for direct functions
	for use in SPL).
