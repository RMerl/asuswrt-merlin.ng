config DM_REGULATOR
	bool "Enable Driver Model for REGULATOR drivers (UCLASS_REGULATOR)"
	depends on DM
	---help---
	This config enables the driver model regulator support.
	UCLASS_REGULATOR - designed to provide a common API for basic regulator's
	functions, like get/set Voltage or Current value, enable state, etc...
	Note:
	When enabling this, please read the description, found in the files:
