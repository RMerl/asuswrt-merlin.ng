config DEBUG_UART
	bool "Enable an early debug UART for debugging"
	help
	  The debug UART is intended for use very early in U-Boot to debug
	  problems when an ICE or other debug mechanism is not available.

	  To use it you should:
	  - Make sure your UART supports this interface
	  - Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_UART
	  - Enable the CONFIG for your UART to tell it to provide this interface
	        (e.g. CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_NS16550)
	  - Define the required settings as needed (see below)
	  - Call debug_uart_init() before use
	  - Call debug_uart_putc() to output a character

	  Depending on your platform it may be possible to use this UART before
	  a stack is available.

	  If your UART does not support this interface you can probably add
	  support quite easily. Remember that you cannot use driver model and
	  it is preferred to use no stack.

	  You must not use this UART once driver model is working and the
	  serial drivers are up and running (done in serial_init()). Otherwise
	  the drivers may conflict and you will get strange output.
