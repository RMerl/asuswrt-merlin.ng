config TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for timer access. It uses the same API as
	  lib/time.c, but now implemented by the uclass. The first timer
	  will be used. The timer is usually a 32 bits free-running up
	  counter. There may be no real tick, and no timer interrupt.

config SPL_TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers in SPL"
	depends on TIMER && SPL
	help
	  Enable support for timer drivers in SPL. These can be used to get
	  a timer value when in SPL, or perhaps for implementing a delay
	  function. This enables the drivers in drivers/timer as part of an
	  SPL build.

config TPL_TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers in TPL"
	depends on TIMER && TPL
	help
	  Enable support for timer drivers in TPL. These can be used to get
	  a timer value when in TPL, or perhaps for implementing a delay
	  function. This enables the drivers in drivers/timer as part of an
	  TPL build.

config TIMER_EARLY
	bool "Allow timer to be used early in U-Boot"
	depends on TIMER
	# initr_bootstage() requires a timer and is called before initr_dm()
	# so only the early timer is available
	default y if X86 && BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  In some cases the timer must be accessible before driver model is
	  active. Examples include when using CONFIG_TRACE to trace U-Boot's
	  execution before driver model is set up. Enable this option to
	  use an early timer. These functions must be supported by your timer
	  driver: timer_early_get_count() and timer_early_get_rate().

config AG101P_TIMER
	bool "AG101P timer support"
	depends on TIMER && NDS32
	help
	  Select this to enable a timer for AG01P devices.

config ALTERA_TIMER
	bool "Altera timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable a timer for Altera devices. Please find
	  details on the "Embedded Peripherals IP User Guide" of Altera.

config ARC_TIMER
	bool "ARC timer support"
	depends on TIMER && ARC && CLK
	help
	  Select this to enable built-in ARC timers.
	  ARC cores may have up to 2 built-in timers: timer0 and timer1,
	  usually at least one of them exists. Either of them is supported
	  in U-Boot.

config AST_TIMER
	bool "Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	default y if ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Select this to enable timer for Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 devices.
	  This is a simple sys timer driver, it is compatible with lib/time.c,
	  but does not support any interrupts. Even though SoC has 8 hardware
	  counters, they are all treated as a single device by this driver.
	  This is mostly because they all share several registers which
	  makes it difficult to completely separate them.

config ATCPIT100_TIMER
	bool "ATCPIT100 timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable a ATCPIT100 timer which will be embedded
	  in AE3XX, AE250 boards.

config ATMEL_PIT_TIMER
	bool "Atmel periodic interval timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable a periodic interval timer for Atmel devices,
	  it is designed to offer maximum accuracy and efficient management,
	  even for systems with long response time.

config CADENCE_TTC_TIMER
	bool "Cadence TTC (Triple Timer Counter)"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Enables support for the cadence ttc driver. This driver is present
	  on Xilinx Zynq and ZynqMP SoCs.

config DESIGNWARE_APB_TIMER
	bool "Designware APB Timer"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Enables support for the Designware APB Timer driver. This timer is
	  present on Altera SoCFPGA SoCs.

config MPC83XX_TIMER
	bool "MPC83xx timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable support for the timer found on
	  devices based on the MPC83xx family of SoCs.

config RENESAS_OSTM_TIMER
	bool "Renesas RZ/A1 R7S72100 OSTM Timer"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Enables support for the Renesas OSTM Timer driver.
	  This timer is present on Renesas RZ/A1 R7S72100 SoCs.

config X86_TSC_TIMER_EARLY_FREQ
	int "x86 TSC timer frequency in MHz when used as the early timer"
	depends on X86_TSC_TIMER
	default 1000
	help
	  Sets the estimated CPU frequency in MHz when TSC is used as the
	  early timer and the frequency can neither be calibrated via some
	  hardware ways, nor got from device tree at the time when device
	  tree is not available yet.

config OMAP_TIMER
	bool "Omap timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable an timer for Omap devices.

config RISCV_TIMER
	bool "RISC-V timer support"
	depends on TIMER && RISCV
	help
	  Select this to enable support for the timer as defined
	  by the RISC-V privileged architecture spec.

config ROCKCHIP_TIMER
	bool "Rockchip timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable support for the timer found on
	  Rockchip devices.

config SANDBOX_TIMER
	bool "Sandbox timer support"
	depends on SANDBOX && TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable an emulated timer for sandbox. It gets
	  time from host os.

config STI_TIMER
	bool "STi timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	default y if ARCH_STI
	help
	  Select this to enable a timer for STi devices.

config STM32_TIMER
	bool "STM32 timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable support for the timer found on
	  STM32 devices.

config X86_TSC_TIMER
	bool "x86 Time-Stamp Counter (TSC) timer support"
	depends on TIMER && X86
	help
	  Select this to enable Time-Stamp Counter (TSC) timer for x86.

config MTK_TIMER
	bool "MediaTek timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable support for the timer found on
	  MediaTek devices.

config BCM6XXX_TIMER
	bool "Broadcom 6XXX SoC timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable peripheral timer support for Broadcom
	  6XXX SoC devices
