#
# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

menuconfig USB_GADGET
	bool "USB Gadget Support"
	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   U-Boot can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run U-Boot inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.

	help
	   Some devices need to draw power from USB when they are
	   configured, perhaps to operate circuitry or to recharge
	   batteries.  This is in addition to any local power supply,
	   such as an AC adapter or batteries.

	   Enter the maximum power your device draws through USB, in
	   milliAmperes.  The permitted range of values is 2 - 500 mA;
	   0 mA would be legal, but can make some hosts misbehave.

	   This value will be used except for system-specific gadget
	   drivers that have more specific information.

	help
	  There is several models (protocols) to implement Ethernet over USB
	  devices. The main ones are Microsoft's RNDIS and USB's CDC-Ethernet
	  (also called CDC-ECM). RNDIS is obviously compatible with Windows,
	  while CDC-ECM is not. Most other operating systems support both, so
	  if inter-operability is a concern, RNDIS is to be preferred.

config USB_ETH_CDC
	bool "CDC-ECM Protocol"
	help
	  CDC (Communications Device Class) is the standard for Ethernet over
	  USB devices. While there's several alternatives, the most widely used
	  protocol is ECM (Ethernet Control Model). However, compatibility with
	  Windows is not that great.

config USB_ETH_RNDIS
	bool "RNDIS Protocol"
	help
	  The RNDIS (Remote Network Driver Interface Specification) is a
	  Microsoft proprietary protocol to create an Ethernet device over USB.
	  Windows obviously supports it, as well as all the major operating
	  systems, so it's the best option for compatibility.
