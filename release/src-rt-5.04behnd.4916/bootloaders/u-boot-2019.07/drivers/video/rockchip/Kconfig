# Video drivers selection for rockchip soc. These configs only impact the
# compile process. You can surely check all the options. In this case, all the
# display driver will be compiled, but which drivers finally  will be used is
# decided by device tree configuration. What's more, enable needed power for
# display by configure the device tree, and the vop driver will do the rest.
