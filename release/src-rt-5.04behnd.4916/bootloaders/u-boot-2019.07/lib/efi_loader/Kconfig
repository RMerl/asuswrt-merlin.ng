	  Select this option if you want to run UEFI applications (like GNU

	  will expose the UEFI API to a loaded application, enabling it to

	help
	  The Human Interface Infrastructure is a complicated framework that

	  In EFI 1.10 a version of the Unicode collation protocol using ISO

	  specification any longer. Unfortunately it is required to run the
	  UEFI Self Certification Test (SCT) II, version 2.6, 2017.
