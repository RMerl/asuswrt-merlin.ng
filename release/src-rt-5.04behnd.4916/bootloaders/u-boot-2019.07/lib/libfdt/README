To adapt for U-Boot usage, only the applicable files were copied and
imported into the U-Boot Git repository.

Omitted:

  * GPL - U-Boot comes with a copy of the GPL license
  * test subdirectory - not directly useful for U-Boot

After importing, other customizations were performed.  See the
"git log" for details.
