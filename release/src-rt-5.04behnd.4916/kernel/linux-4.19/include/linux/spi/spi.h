 * @bits_per_word: Data transfers involve one or more words; word sizes
 *	like eight or 12 bits are common.  In-memory wordsizes are
 *	powers of two bytes (e.g. 20 bit samples use 32 bits).

 * @num_chipselect: chipselects are used to distinguish individual

 *	every chipselect is connected to a slave.
 * @dma_alignment: SPI controller constraint on DMA buffers alignment.
 * @mode_bits: flags understood by this controller driver
 * @bits_per_word_mask: A mask indicating which values of bits_per_word are

 *	supported. If set, the SPI core will reject any transfer with an
 *	unsupported bits_per_word. If not set, this value is simply ignored,
 *	and it's up to the individual driver to perform any validation.
 * @min_speed_hz: Lowest supported transfer speed
 * @max_speed_hz: Highest supported transfer speed
 * @flags: other constraints relevant to this driver
 * @slave: indicates that this is an SPI slave controller
 * @max_transfer_size: function that returns the max transfer size for
 *	a &spi_device; may be %NULL, so the default %SIZE_MAX will be used.
 * @max_message_size: function that returns the max message size for
 *	a &spi_device; may be %NULL, so the default %SIZE_MAX will be used.
 * @io_mutex: mutex for physical bus access
 * @bus_lock_spinlock: spinlock for SPI bus locking
 * @bus_lock_mutex: mutex for exclusion of multiple callers
 * @bus_lock_flag: indicates that the SPI bus is locked for exclusive use
 * @setup: updates the device mode and clocking records used by a
 *	device's SPI controller; protocol code may call this.  This
 *	must fail if an unrecognized or unsupported mode is requested.
 *	It's always safe to call this unless transfers are pending on
 *	the device whose settings are being modified.
 * @transfer: adds a message to the controller's transfer queue.
 * @cleanup: frees controller-specific state
 * @can_dma: determine whether this controller supports DMA
 * @queued: whether this controller is providing an internal message queue
 * @kworker: thread struct for message pump
 * @kworker_task: pointer to task for message pump kworker thread
 * @pump_messages: work struct for scheduling work to the message pump
 * @queue_lock: spinlock to syncronise access to message queue

 * @cur_msg_mapped: message has been mapped for DMA
 * @xfer_completion: used by core transfer_one_message()
 * @busy: message pump is busy
 * @running: message pump is running
 * @rt: whether this queue is set to run as a realtime task
 * @auto_runtime_pm: the core should ensure a runtime PM reference is held
 *                   while the hardware is prepared, using the parent
 *                   device for the spidev
 * @max_dma_len: Maximum length of a DMA transfer for the device.
 * @prepare_transfer_hardware: a message will soon arrive from the queue
 *	so the subsystem requests the driver to prepare the transfer hardware
 *	by issuing this call
 * @transfer_one_message: the subsystem calls the driver to transfer a single
 *	message while queuing transfers that arrive in the meantime. When the
 *	driver is finished with this message, it must call
 *	spi_finalize_current_message() so the subsystem can issue the next
 *	message
 * @unprepare_transfer_hardware: there are currently no more messages on the
 *	queue so the subsystem notifies the driver that it may relax the
 *	hardware by issuing this call
 * @set_cs: set the logic level of the chip select line.  May be called
 *          from interrupt context.
 * @prepare_message: set up the controller to transfer a single message,
 *                   for example doing DMA mapping.  Called from threaded
 *                   context.
 * @transfer_one: transfer a single spi_transfer.
 *                  - return 0 if the transfer is finished,
 *                  - return 1 if the transfer is still in progress. When
 *                    the driver is finished with this transfer it must
 *                    call spi_finalize_current_transfer() so the subsystem
 *                    can issue the next transfer. Note: transfer_one and
 *                    transfer_one_message are mutually exclusive; when both
 *                    are set, the generic subsystem does not call your
 *                    transfer_one callback.
 * @handle_err: the subsystem calls the driver to handle an error that occurs
 *		in the generic implementation of transfer_one_message().
 * @mem_ops: optimized/dedicated operations for interactions with SPI memory.
 *	     This field is optional and should only be implemented if the
 *	     controller has native support for memory like operations.
 * @unprepare_message: undo any work done by prepare_message().
 * @slave_abort: abort the ongoing transfer request on an SPI slave controller
 * @cs_gpios: Array of GPIOs to use as chip select lines; one per CS
 *	number. Any individual value may be -ENOENT for CS lines that
 *	are not GPIOs (driven by the SPI controller itself).
 * @statistics: statistics for the spi_controller
 * @dma_tx: DMA transmit channel
 * @dma_rx: DMA receive channel
 * @dummy_rx: dummy receive buffer for full-duplex devices
 * @dummy_tx: dummy transmit buffer for full-duplex devices
 * @fw_translate_cs: If the boot firmware uses different numbering scheme
 *	what Linux expects, this optional hook can be used to translate
 *	between the two.
 *
 * Each SPI controller can communicate with one or more @spi_device
 * children.  These make a small bus, sharing MOSI, MISO and SCK signals
 * but not chip select signals.  Each device may be configured to use a
 * different clock rate, since those shared signals are ignored unless
 * the chip is selected.
 *
 * The driver for an SPI controller manages access to those devices through
 * a queue of spi_message transactions, copying data between CPU memory and
 * an SPI slave device.  For each such message it queues, it calls the
 * message's completion function when the transaction completes.

 * I/O INTERFACE between SPI controller and protocol drivers

 *
 * The spi_messages themselves consist of a series of read+write transfer
 * segments.  Those segments always read the same number of bits as they
 * write; but one or the other is easily ignored by passing a null buffer
 * pointer.  (This is unlike most types of I/O API, because SPI hardware
 * is full duplex.)
 *
 * NOTE:  Allocation of spi_transfer and spi_message memory is entirely
 * up to the protocol driver, which guarantees the integrity of both (as
 * well as the data buffers) for as long as the message is queued.

 * @rx_dma: DMA address of rx_buf, if @spi_message.is_dma_mapped
 * @tx_nbits: number of bits used for writing. If 0 the default
 *      (SPI_NBITS_SINGLE) is used.
 * @rx_nbits: number of bits used for reading. If 0 the default
 *      (SPI_NBITS_SINGLE) is used.
 * @len: size of rx and tx buffers (in bytes)
 * @speed_hz: Select a speed other than the device default for this
 *      transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @bits_per_word: select a bits_per_word other than the device default
 *      for this transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @cs_change: affects chipselect after this transfer completes
 * @delay_usecs: microseconds to delay after this transfer before
 *	(optionally) changing the chipselect status, then starting
 *	the next transfer or completing this @spi_message.
 * @transfer_list: transfers are sequenced through @spi_message.transfers
 * @tx_sg: Scatterlist for transmit, currently not for client use
 * @rx_sg: Scatterlist for receive, currently not for client use
 *
 * SPI transfers always write the same number of bytes as they read.
 * Protocol drivers should always provide @rx_buf and/or @tx_buf.
 * In some cases, they may also want to provide DMA addresses for
 * the data being transferred; that may reduce overhead, when the
 * underlying driver uses dma.
 *
 * If the transmit buffer is null, zeroes will be shifted out
 * while filling @rx_buf.  If the receive buffer is null, the data
 * shifted in will be discarded.  Only "len" bytes shift out (or in).
 * It's an error to try to shift out a partial word.  (For example, by
 * shifting out three bytes with word size of sixteen or twenty bits;
 * the former uses two bytes per word, the latter uses four bytes.)
 *
 * In-memory data values are always in native CPU byte order, translated
 * from the wire byte order (big-endian except with SPI_LSB_FIRST).  So
 * for example when bits_per_word is sixteen, buffers are 2N bytes long
 * (@len = 2N) and hold N sixteen bit words in CPU byte order.
 *
 * When the word size of the SPI transfer is not a power-of-two multiple
 * of eight bits, those in-memory words include extra bits.  In-memory
 * words are always seen by protocol drivers as right-justified, so the
 * undefined (rx) or unused (tx) bits are always the most significant bits.
 *
 * All SPI transfers start with the relevant chipselect active.  Normally
 * it stays selected until after the last transfer in a message.  Drivers
 * can affect the chipselect signal using cs_change.
 *
 * (i) If the transfer isn't the last one in the message, this flag is
 * used to make the chipselect briefly go inactive in the middle of the
 * message.  Toggling chipselect in this way may be needed to terminate
 * a chip command, letting a single spi_message perform all of group of
 * chip transactions together.
 *
 * (ii) When the transfer is the last one in the message, the chip may
 * stay selected until the next transfer.  On multi-device SPI busses
 * with nothing blocking messages going to other devices, this is just
 * a performance hint; starting a message to another device deselects
 * this one.  But in other cases, this can be used to ensure correctness.
 * Some devices need protocol transactions to be built from a series of
 * spi_message submissions, where the content of one message is determined
 * by the results of previous messages and where the whole transaction
 * ends when the chipselect goes intactive.
 *
 * When SPI can transfer in 1x,2x or 4x. It can get this transfer information
 * from device through @tx_nbits and @rx_nbits. In Bi-direction, these
 * two should both be set. User can set transfer mode with SPI_NBITS_SINGLE(1x)
 * SPI_NBITS_DUAL(2x) and SPI_NBITS_QUAD(4x) to support these three transfer.
 *
 * The code that submits an spi_message (and its spi_transfers)
