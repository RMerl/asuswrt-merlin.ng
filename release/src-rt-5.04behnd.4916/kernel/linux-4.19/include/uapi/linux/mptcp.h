 * Events generated by MPTCP:
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_CREATED: token, family, saddr4 | saddr6, daddr4 | daddr6,
 *                          sport, dport
 *       A new connection has been created. It is the good time to allocate
 *       memory and send ADD_ADDR if needed. Depending on the traffic-patterns
 *       it can take a long time until the MPTCP_EVENT_ESTABLISHED is sent.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_ESTABLISHED: token, family, saddr4 | saddr6, daddr4 | daddr6,
 *                              sport, dport
 *       A connection is established (can start new subflows).
 *
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_CLOSED: token
 *       A connection has stopped.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_ANNOUNCED: token, rem_id, family, daddr4 | daddr6 [, dport]
 *       A new address has been announced by the peer.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_REMOVED: token, rem_id
 *       An address has been lost by the peer.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_SUB_ESTABLISHED: token, family, saddr4 | saddr6,
 *                                  daddr4 | daddr6, sport, dport, backup,
 *                                  if_idx [, error]
 *       A new subflow has been established. 'error' should not be set.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_SUB_CLOSED: token, family, saddr4 | saddr6, daddr4 | daddr6,
 *                             sport, dport, backup, if_idx [, error]
 *       A subflow has been closed. An error (copy of sk_err) could be set if an
 *       error has been detected for this subflow.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_EVENT_SUB_PRIORITY: token, family, saddr4 | saddr6, daddr4 | daddr6,
 *                               sport, dport, backup, if_idx [, error]
 *       The priority of a subflow has changed. 'error' should not be set.
 *
 * Commands for MPTCP:
 *   - MPTCP_CMD_ANNOUNCE: token, loc_id, family, saddr4 | saddr6 [, sport]
 *       Announce a new address to the peer.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_CMD_REMOVE: token, loc_id
 *       Announce that an address has been lost to the peer.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_CMD_SUB_CREATE: token, family, loc_id, rem_id, [saddr4 | saddr6,
 *                           daddr4 | daddr6, dport [, sport, backup, if_idx]]
 *       Create a new subflow.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_CMD_SUB_DESTROY: token, family, saddr4 | saddr6, daddr4 | daddr6,
 *                            sport, dport
 *       Close a subflow.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_CMD_SUB_PRIORITY: token, family, saddr4 | saddr6, daddr4 | daddr6,
 *                             sport, dport, backup
 *       Change the priority of a subflow.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_CMD_SET_FILTER: flags
 *       Set the filter on events. Set MPTCPF_* flags to only receive specific
 *       events. Default is to receive all events.
 *
 *   - MPTCP_CMD_EXIST: token
 *       Check if this token is linked to an existing socket.
