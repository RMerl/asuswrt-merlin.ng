 *
 * The STUN transport provides asynchronous UDP like socket transport
 * with the additional STUN capability. It has the following features:
 *
 *  - API to send and receive UDP packets
 *
 *  - multiplex STUN and non-STUN incoming packets and distinguish between
 *    STUN responses that belong to internal requests with application data
 *    (the application data may be STUN packets as well)
 *
 *  - DNS SRV resolution to the STUN server (if wanted), along with fallback
 *    to DNS A resolution if SRV record is not found.
 *
 *  - STUN keep-alive maintenance, and handle changes to the mapped address
 *    (when the NAT binding changes)
 *
