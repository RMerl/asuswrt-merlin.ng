 * @brief Establish an MQTT session.

 * This function will send MQTT CONNECT packet and receive a CONNACK packet. The

 * The maximum time this function waits for a CONNACK is decided in one of the
 * following ways:
 * 1. If @p timeoutMs is greater than 0:
 *    #MQTTContext_t.getTime is used to ensure that the function does not wait
 *    more than @p timeoutMs for CONNACK.
 * 2. If @p timeoutMs is 0:
 *    The network receive for CONNACK is retried up to the number of times
 *    configured by #MQTT_MAX_CONNACK_RECEIVE_RETRY_COUNT.
 *
 * @note If a dummy #MQTTGetCurrentTimeFunc_t was passed to #MQTT_Init, then a
 * timeout value of 0 MUST be passed to the API, and the #MQTT_RECV_POLLING_TIMEOUT_MS
 * and #MQTT_SEND_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS timeout configurations MUST be set to 0.
 *
 * @param[in] pContext Initialized MQTT context.
 * @param[in] pConnectInfo MQTT CONNECT packet information.
 * @param[in] pWillInfo Last Will and Testament. Pass NULL if Last Will and
 * Testament is not used.
 * @param[in] timeoutMs Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a CONNACK packet.
 * A zero timeout makes use of the retries for receiving CONNACK as configured with
 * #MQTT_MAX_CONNACK_RECEIVE_RETRY_COUNT.
 * @param[out] pSessionPresent Whether a previous session was present.
 * Only relevant if not establishing a clean session.
 *
 * @return #MQTTNoMemory if the #MQTTContext_t.networkBuffer is too small to
 * hold the MQTT packet;
 * #MQTTBadParameter if invalid parameters are passed;
 * #MQTTSendFailed if transport send failed;
 * #MQTTRecvFailed if transport receive failed for CONNACK;
 * #MQTTNoDataAvailable if no data available to receive in transport until
 * the @p timeoutMs for CONNACK;
 * #MQTTSuccess otherwise.
 *
 * @note This API may spend more time than provided in the timeoutMS parameters in
 * certain conditions as listed below:
 *
 * 1. Timeouts are incorrectly configured - If the timeoutMS is less than the
 *    transport receive timeout and if a CONNACK packet is not received within
 *    the transport receive timeout, the API will spend the transport receive
 *    timeout (which is more time than the timeoutMs). It is the case of incorrect
 *    timeout configuration as the timeoutMs parameter passed to this API must be
 *    greater than the transport receive timeout. Please refer to the transport
 *    interface documentation for more details about timeout configurations.
 *
 * 2. Partial CONNACK packet is received right before the expiry of the timeout - It
 *    is possible that first two bytes of CONNACK packet (packet type and remaining
 *    length) are received right before the expiry of the timeoutMS. In that case,
 *    the API makes one more network receive call in an attempt to receive the remaining
 *    2 bytes. In the worst case, it can happen that the remaining 2 bytes are never
 *    received and this API will end up spending timeoutMs + transport receive timeout.
