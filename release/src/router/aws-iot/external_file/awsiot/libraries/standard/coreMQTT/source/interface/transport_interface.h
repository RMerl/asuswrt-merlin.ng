/**
 * @transportpage
 * @brief The transport interface definition.
 *
 * @transportsectionoverview
 *
 * The transport interface is a set of APIs that must be implemented using an
 * external transport layer protocol. The transport interface is defined in
 * @ref transport_interface.h. This interface allows protocols like MQTT and
 * HTTP to send and receive data over the transport layer. This
 * interface does not handle connection and disconnection to the server of
 * interest. The connection, disconnection, and other transport settings, like
 * timeout and TLS setup, must be handled in the user application.
 * <br>
 *
 * The functions that must be implemented are:<br>
 * - [Transport Receive](@ref TransportRecv_t)
 * - [Transport Send](@ref TransportSend_t)
 *
 * Each of the functions above take in an opaque context @ref NetworkContext_t.
 * The functions above and the context are also grouped together in the
 * @ref TransportInterface_t structure:<br><br>
 * @snippet this define_transportinterface
 * <br>
 *
 * @transportsectionimplementation
 *
 * The following steps give guidance on implementing the transport interface:
 *
 * -# Implementing @ref NetworkContext_t<br><br>
 * @snippet this define_networkcontext
 * <br>
 * @ref NetworkContext_t is the incomplete type <b>struct NetworkContext</b>.
 * The implemented struct NetworkContext must contain all of the information
 * that is needed to receive and send data with the @ref TransportRecv_t
 * and the @ref TransportSend_t implementations.<br>
 * In the case of TLS over TCP, struct NetworkContext is typically implemented
 * with the TCP socket context and a TLS context.<br><br>
 * <b>Example code:</b>
 * @code{c}
 * struct NetworkContext
 * {
 *     struct MyTCPSocketContext tcpSocketContext;
 *     struct MyTLSContext tlsContext;
 * };
 * @endcode
 * <br>
 * -# Implementing @ref TransportRecv_t<br><br>
 * @snippet this define_transportrecv
 * <br>
 * This function is expected to populate a buffer, with bytes received from the
 * transport, and return the number of bytes placed in the buffer.
 * In the case of TLS over TCP, @ref TransportRecv_t is typically implemented by
 * calling the TLS layer function to receive data. In case of plaintext TCP
 * without TLS, it is typically implemented by calling the TCP layer receive
 * function. @ref TransportRecv_t may be invoked multiple times by the protocol
 * library, if fewer bytes than were requested to receive are returned.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Example code:</b>
 * @code{c}
 * int32_t myNetworkRecvImplementation( NetworkContext_t * pNetworkContext,
 *                                      void * pBuffer,
 *                                      size_t bytesToRecv )
 * {
 *     int32_t bytesReceived = 0;
 *     bool callTlsRecvFunc = true;
 *
 *     // For a single byte read request, check if data is available on the network.
 *     if( bytesToRecv == 1 )
 *     {
 *        // If no data is available on the network, do not call TLSRecv
 *        // to avoid blocking for socket timeout.
 *        if( TLSRecvCount( pNetworkContext->tlsContext ) == 0 )
 *        {
 *            callTlsRecvFunc = false;
 *        }
 *     }
 *
 *     if( callTlsRecvFunc == true )
 *     {
 *        bytesReceived = TLSRecv( pNetworkContext->tlsContext,
 *                                 pBuffer,
 *                                 bytesToRecv,
 *                                 MY_SOCKET_TIMEOUT );
 *        if( bytesReceived < 0 )
 *        {
 *           // If the error code represents a timeout, then the return
 *           // code should be translated to zero so that the caller
 *           // can retry the read operation.
 *           if( bytesReceived == MY_SOCKET_ERROR_TIMEOUT )
 *           {
 *              bytesReceived = 0;
 *           }
 *        }
 *        // Handle other cases.
 *     }
 *     return bytesReceived;
 * }
 * @endcode
 * <br>
 * -# Implementing @ref TransportSend_t<br><br>
 * @snippet this define_transportsend
 * <br>
 * This function is expected to send the bytes, in the given buffer over the
 * transport, and return the number of bytes sent.
 * In the case of TLS over TCP, @ref TransportSend_t is typically implemented by
 * calling the TLS layer function to send data. In case of plaintext TCP
 * without TLS, it is typically implemented by calling the TCP layer send
 * function. @ref TransportSend_t may be invoked multiple times by the protocol
 * library, if fewer bytes than were requested to send are returned.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Example code:</b>
 * @code{c}
 * int32_t myNetworkSendImplementation( NetworkContext_t * pNetworkContext,
 *                                      const void * pBuffer,
 *                                      size_t bytesToSend )
 * {
 *     int32_t bytesSent = 0;
 *     bytesSent = TLSSend( pNetworkContext->tlsContext,
 *                          pBuffer,
 *                          bytesToSend,
 *                          MY_SOCKET_TIMEOUT );
 *
 *      // If underlying TCP buffer is full, set the return value to zero
 *      // so that caller can retry the send operation.
 *     if( bytesSent == MY_SOCKET_ERROR_BUFFER_FULL )
 *     {
 *          bytesSent = 0;
 *     }
 *     else if( bytesSent < 0 )
 *     {
 *         // Handle socket error.
 *     }
 *     // Handle other cases.
 *
 *     return bytesSent;
