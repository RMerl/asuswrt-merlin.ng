 *
 * Each library should specify a log level by setting @ref LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL.
 * All log messages with a level at or below the specified level will be printed
 * for that library.
 *
 * Currently, there are 4 log levels. In the order of lowest to highest, they are:
 * - #LOG_NONE <br>
 *   @copybrief LOG_NONE
 * - #LOG_ERROR <br>
 *   @copybrief LOG_ERROR
 * - #LOG_WARN <br>
 *   @copybrief LOG_WARN
 * - #LOG_INFO <br>
 *   @copybrief LOG_INFO
 * - #LOG_DEBUG <br>
 *   @copybrief LOG_DEBUG
