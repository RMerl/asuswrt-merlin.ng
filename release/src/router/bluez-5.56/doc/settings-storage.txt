BlueZ settings storage
**********************

Purpose
=======

The purpose of this document is to describe the directory structure of
BlueZ settings storage. In effect, this document will serve as the primary,
up to date source of BlueZ storage information.

It is intended as reference for developers. Direct access to the storage
outside from bluetoothd is highly discouraged.

Adapter and remote device info are read form the storage during object
initialization. Write to storage is performed immediately on every value
change.

Default storage directory is /var/lib/bluetooth. This can be adjusted
by the --localstatedir configure switch. Default is --localstatedir=/var.

All files are in ini-file format.


Storage directory structure
===========================

The storage root directory contains an optional addresses file that's
used for managing adapters that come without a pre-allocated address.
The format of the addresses file is:

	[Static]
	<manufacturer id> = <array of addresses>

Each adapter with an assigned address has its own subdirectory under the
root, named based on the address, which contains:

 - a settings file for the local adapter
 - an attributes file containing attributes of supported LE services
 - a cache directory containing:
    - one file per device, named by remote device address, which contains
    device name
 - one directory per remote device, named by remote device address, which
   contains:
    - an info file
    - an attributes file containing attributes of remote LE services
    - a ccc file containing persistent Client Characteristic Configuration
      (CCC) descriptor information for GATT characteristics

So the directory structure is:
    /var/lib/bluetooth/<adapter address>/
        ./settings
        ./attributes
        ./cache/
            ./<remote device address>
            ./<remote device address>
            ...
        ./<remote device address>/
            ./info
            ./attributes
            ./ccc
        ./<remote device address>/
            ./info
            ./attributes
        ...


Settings file format
====================

Settings file contains one [General] group with adapter info like:

  Alias			String		Friendly user provided name advertised
					for this adapter

					This value overwrites the system
					name (pretty hostname)

  Discoverable		Boolean		Discoverability of the adapter

  PairableTimeout	Integer		How long to stay in pairable mode
					before going back to non-pairable.
					The value is in seconds.
					0 = disable timer, i.e. stay
					pairable forever

  DiscoverableTimeout	Integer		How long to stay in discoverable mode
					before going back to non-discoverable.
					The value is in seconds.
					0 = disable timer, i.e. stay
					discoverable forever

Sample:
  [General]
  Name=My PC
  Discoverable=false
  Pairable=true
  DiscoverableTimeout=0


Identity file format
====================
Identity file contains one [General] group that holds identity information
such as keys and adresses:

	IdentityResolvingKey	String	128-bit value of the IRK

Sample:
  [General]
  IdentityResolvingKey=00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff


Attributes file format
======================

The attributes file lists all attributes supported by the local adapter or
remote device.

Attributes are stored using their handle as group name (decimal format).

Each group contains:

  UUID			String		128-bit UUID of the attribute

  Value			String		Value of the attribute as hexadecimal encoded
					string

  EndGroupHandle	Integer		End group handle in decimal format

Sample:
  [1]
  UUID=00002800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
  Value=0018

  [4]
  UUID=00002803-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
  Value=020600002A

  [6]
  UUID=00002a00-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
  Value=4578616D706C6520446576696365


CCC file format
======================

The ccc file stores the current CCC descriptor values for GATT characteristics
which have notification/indication enabled by the remote device.

Information is stored using CCC attribute handle as group name (in decimal
format).

Each group contains:

  Value			String		CCC descriptor value encoded in
					hexadecimal


Cache directory file format
============================

Each file, named by remote device address, may includes multiple groups
(General, ServiceRecords, Attributes, Endpoints).

In ServiceRecords, SDP records are stored using their handle as key
(hexadecimal format).

In "Attributes" group GATT database is stored using attribute handle as key
(hexadecimal format). Value associated with this handle is serialized form of
all data required to re-create given attribute. ":" is used to separate fields.

In "Endpoints" group A2DP remote endpoints are stored using the seid as key
(hexadecimal format) and ":" is used to separate fields. It may also contain
an entry which key is set to "LastUsed" which represented the last endpoint
used.

[General] group contains:

  Name		String		Remote device friendly name

  ShortName	String		Remote device shortened name

[ServiceRecords] group contains

  <0x...>	String		SDP record as hexadecimal encoded
				string

In [Attributes] group value always starts with attribute type, that determines
how to interpret rest of value:

  Primary service:
    2800:end_handle:uuid

  Secondary service:
    2801:end_handle:uuid

  Included service:
    2802:start_handle:end_handle:uuid

  Characteristic:
    2803:value_handle:properties:uuid

  Descriptor:
    value:uuid
    uuid

Sample Attributes section:
  [Attributes]
  0001=2800:0005:1801
  0002=2803:0003:20:2a05
  0014=2800:001c:1800
  0015=2803:0016:02:2a00
  0017=2803:0018:02:2a01
  0019=2803:001a:02:2aa6
  0028=2800:ffff:0000180d-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
  0029=2803:002a:10:00002a37-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
  002b=2803:002c:02:00002a38-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
  002d=2803:002e:08:00002a39-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

[Endpoints] group contains:

	<xx>:<xx>:<xx>::<xx...> String	First field is the endpoint type,
					followed by codec type and delay
					reporting and its
					capabilities as hexadecimal encoded
					string.
	LastUsed:<xx>:<xx>	String	LastUsed has two fields which are the
					local and remote seids as hexadecimal
					encoded string.
