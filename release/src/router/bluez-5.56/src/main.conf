# Do reverse service discovery for previously unknown devices that connect to
# us. For BR/EDR this option is really only needed for qualification since the

# Devices (MPMD) configurations.
# Possible values: "off", "single", "multiple"
#MultiProfile = off

# Permanently enables the Fast Connectable setting for adapters that
# support it. When enabled other devices can connect faster to us,
# however the tradeoff is increased power consumptions. This feature
# will fully work only on kernel version 4.1 and newer. Defaults to
# 'false'.

# Default privacy setting.
# Enables use of private address.
# Possible values: "off", "device", "network"

# Enables the device to issue an SDP request to update known services when
# profile is connected. Defaults to true.
#RefreshDiscovery = true

[BR]
# The following values are used to load default adapter parameters for BR/EDR.
# BlueZ loads the values into the kernel before the adapter is powered if the
# kernel supports the MGMT_LOAD_DEFAULT_PARAMETERS command. If a value isn't
# provided, the kernel will be initialized to it's default value.  The actual
# value will vary based on the kernel version and thus aren't provided here.
# The Bluetooth Core Specification should be consulted for the meaning and valid
# domain of each of these values.

[Policy]
#
# The ReconnectUUIDs defines the set of remote services that should try
# to be reconnected to in case of a link loss (link supervision
# timeout). The policy plugin should contain a sane set of values by
# default, but this list can be overridden here. By setting the list to
# empty the reconnection feature gets disabled.

# ReconnectAttempts define the number of attempts to reconnect after a link
# lost. Setting the value to 0 disables reconnecting feature.
#ReconnectAttempts=7

# ReconnectIntervals define the set of intervals in seconds to use in between
# attempts.
# If the number of attempts defined in ReconnectAttempts is bigger than the
# set of intervals the last interval is repeated until the last attempt.

# AutoEnable defines option to enable all controllers when they are found.
# This includes adapters present on start as well as adapters that are plugged
# in later on. Defaults to 'false'.
#AutoEnable=false

# Audio devices that were disconnected due to suspend will be reconnected on
# resume. ResumeDelay determines the delay between when the controller
# resumes from suspend and a connection attempt is made. A longer delay is
# better for better co-existence with Wi-Fi.
# The value is in seconds.
# Default: 2
