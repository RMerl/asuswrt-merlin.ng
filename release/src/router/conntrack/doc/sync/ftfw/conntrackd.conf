	# If the daemon detects that Netlink is dropping state-change events,

	# in terms of CPU consumption since the daemon has to get the full

	# By default, the daemon receives state updates following an

	# is the reduction in the state replication at the cost of reducing the

	# The daemon prioritizes the handling of state-change events coming

	# state-change events (those coming from kernel-space) that the daemon
	# will handle after which it will handle other events coming from the
	# network or userspace. A low value improves interactivity (in terms of

	# filter-sets in positive or negative logic depending on your needs.
	# You can select if conntrackd filters the event messages from 
	# user-space or kernel-space. The kernel-space event filtering
	# saves some CPU cycles by avoiding the copy of the event message
	# from kernel-space to user-space. The kernel-space event filtering
	# is prefered, however, you require a Linux kernel >= 2.6.29 to
