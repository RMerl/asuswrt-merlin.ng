Version 7.57.0 (29 Nov 2017)

Daniel Stenberg (29 Nov 2017)
- RELEASE-NOTES: curl 7.57.0

- THANKS: added contributors from 7.57.0 release

- openssl: fix boringssl build again
  
  commit d3ab7c5a21e broke the boringssl build since it doesn't have
  RSA_flags(), so we disable that code block for boringssl builds.
  
  Reported-by: W. Mark Kubacki
  Fixes #2117

- curl_ntlm_core.c: use the limits.h's SIZE_T_MAX if provided

- libcurl-share.3: the connection cache is shareable now

- global_init: ignore CURL_GLOBAL_SSL's absense
  
  This bit is no longer used. It is not clear what it meant for users to
  "init the TLS" in a world with different TLS backends and since the
  introduction of multissl, libcurl didn't properly work if inited without
  this bit set.
  
  Not a single user responded to the call for users of it:

  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2017-11e7.html

- wildcardmatch: fix heap buffer overflow in setcharset
  
  The code would previous read beyond the end of the pattern string if the
  match pattern ends with an open bracket when the default pattern
  matching function is used.

  CVE-2017-8817
  
  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2017-ae72.html

- [Jay Satiro brought this change]

  url: fix alignment of ssl_backend_data struct
  
  - Align the array of ssl_backend_data on a max 32 byte boundary.
  
  8 is likely to be ok but I went with 32 for posterity should one of
  the ssl_backend_data structs change to contain a larger sized variable
  in the future.
  
  Prior to this change (since dev 70f1db3, release 7.56) the connectdata
  structure was undersized by 4 bytes in 32-bit builds with ssl enabled
  because long long * was mistakenly used for alignment instead of
  long long, with the intention being an 8 byte boundary. Also long long
  may not be an available type.
  
  The undersized connectdata could lead to oob read/write past the end in
  what was expected to be the last 4 bytes of the connection's secondary
  socket https proxy ssl_backend_data struct (the secondary socket in a
  connection is used by ftp, others?).
  
  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/2093
  
  CVE-2017-8818
  
  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2017-af0a.html

- ssh: remove check for a NULL pointer (!)
  
  With this check present, scan-build warns that we might dereference this
  point in other places where it isn't first checked for NULL. Thus, if it
  *can* be NULL we have a problem on a few places. However, this pointer
  should not be possible to be NULL here so I remove the check and thus
  also three different scan-build warnings.
  
  Closes #2111

  Notably, this makes it possible to use TFO with SSL connections on Linux
  as well, without the need to mess around with OpenSSL (or whatever other
  SSL library) internals.

  --interface: add support for Linux VRF
  
  The --interface command (CURLOPT_INTERFACE option) already uses
  SO_BINDTODEVICE on Linux, but it tries to parse it as an interface or IP
  address first, which fails in case the user passes a VRF.
  
  Try to use the socket option immediately and parse it as a fallback
  instead.  Update the documentation to mention this feature, and that it
  requires the binary to be ran by root or with CAP_NET_RAW capabilities
  for this to work.
  
  Closes #2024

  Closes #2061

- connect: store IPv6 connection status after valid connection

- content_encoding: fix inflate_stream for no bytes available
  
  - Don't call zlib's inflate() when avail_in stream bytes is 0.
  
  This is a follow up to the parent commit 19e66e5. Prior to that change
  libcurl's inflate_stream could call zlib's inflate even when no bytes
  were available, causing inflate to return Z_BUF_ERROR, and then
  inflate_stream would treat that as a hard error and return
  CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING.
  
  According to the zlib FAQ, Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal.
  
  This bug would happen randomly since packet sizes are arbitrary. A test
  of 10,000 transfers had 55 fail (ie 0.55%).

  This uses the brotli external library (https://github.com/google/brotli).
  Brotli becomes a feature: additional curl_version_info() bit and
  structure fields are provided for it and CURLVERSION_NOW bumped.
  
  Tests 314 and 315 check Brotli content unencoding with correct and

  Some tests are updated to accomodate with the now configuration dependent
  parameters of the Accept-Encoding header.

- HTTP: support multiple Content-Encodings
  
  This is implemented as an output streaming stack of unencoders, the last
  calling the client write procedure.

- transfer: Fix chunked-encoding upload bug
  
  - When uploading via chunked-encoding don't compare file size to bytes
    sent to determine whether the upload has finished.
  
  Chunked-encoding adds its own overhead which why the bytes sent is not
  equal to the file size. Prior to this change if a file was uploaded in
  chunked-encoding and its size was known it was possible that the upload
  could end prematurely without sending the final few chunks. That would
  result in a server hang waiting for the remaining data, likely followed
  by a disconnect.
  
  The scope of this bug is limited to some arbitrary file sizes which have
  not been determined. One size that triggers the bug is 475020.

  If stdin is not a regular file, its content is memory-buffered to enable
  a possible data "rewind".
  In all cases, stdin data size is determined before real use to avoid

- test650: Use variable replacement to set the host address and port
  
  Otherwise, the test fails when the -b test option is used to set a

- Set and use more necessary options when some protocols are disabled
  
  When curl and libcurl are built with some protocols disabled, they stop
  setting and receiving some options that don't make sense with those
  protocols.  In particular, when HTTP is disabled many options aren't set
  that are used only by HTTP.  However, some options that appear to be
  HTTP-only are actually used by other protocols as well (some despite
  having HTTP in the name) and should be set, but weren't. This change now
  causes some of these options to be set and used for more (or for all)
  protocols. In particular, this fixes tests 646 through 649 in an
  HTTP-disabled build, which use the MIME API in the mail protocols.

- metalink: fix NSS issue in MultiSSL builds
  
  In MultiSSL mode (i.e. when more than one SSL backend is compiled
  in), we cannot use the compile time flag `USE_NSS` as indicator that
  the NSS backend is in use. As far as Metalink is concerned, the SSL
  backend is only used for MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 calculations,
  therefore one of the available SSL backends is selected at compile
  time, in a strict order of preference.
  
  Let's introduce a new `HAVE_NSS_CONTEXT` constant that can be used
  to determine whether the SSL backend used for Metalink is the NSS
  backend, and use that to guard the code that wants to de-initialize
  the NSS-specific data structure.
  
  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1848

- ntlm: use strict order for SSL backend #if branches
  
  With the recently introduced MultiSSL support multiple SSL backends
  can be compiled into cURL That means that now the order of the SSL
  
  One option would be to use the same SSL backend as was configured
  via `curl_global_sslset()`, however, NTLMv2 support would appear
  to be available only with some SSL backends. For example, when
  eb88d778e (ntlm: Use Windows Crypt API, 2014-12-02) introduced
  support for NTLMv1 using Windows' Crypt API, it specifically did
  *not* introduce NTLMv2 support using Crypt API at the same time.
  
  So let's select one specific SSL backend for NTLM support when
  compiled with multiple SSL backends, using a priority order such
  that we support NTLMv2 even if only one compiled-in SSL backend can
  be used for that.

  contents to a memory block so we exercise the data output code but
  quietly.
  
  Closes #1885

- cookies: reject oversized cookies
  
  ... instead of truncating them.
  
  There's no fixed limit for acceptable cookie names in RFC 6265, but the

  also what browsers seem to implement.
  
  We now allow max 5000 bytes cookie header. Max 4095 bytes length per
  cookie name and value. Name + value together may not exceed 4096 bytes.

  OpenSSL: fix erroneous SSL backend encapsulation
  
  In d65e6cc4f (vtls: prepare the SSL backends for encapsulated private
  data, 2017-06-21), this developer prepared for a separation of the
  private data of the SSL backends from the general connection data.
  
  This conversion was partially automated (search-and-replace) and
  partially manual (e.g. proxy_ssl's backend data).
  
  Sadly, there was a crucial error in the manual part, where the wrong
  handle was used: rather than connecting ssl[sockindex]' BIO to the
  proxy_ssl[sockindex]', we reconnected proxy_ssl[sockindex]. The reason
  was an incorrect location to paste "BACKEND->"... d'oh.

- configure: remove --enable-soname-bump and SONAME_BUMP
  
  Back in 2008, (and commit 3f3d6ebe665f3) we changed the logic in how we
  determine the native type for `curl_off_t`. To really make sure we
  didn't break ABI without bumping SONAME, we introduced logic that
  attempted to detect that it would use a different size and thus not be
  compatible. We also provided a manual switch that allowed users to tell
  configure to bump SONAME by force.
  
  Today, we know of no one who ever got a SONAME bump auto-detected and we
  don't know of anyone who's using the manual bump feature. The auto-
  detection is also no longer working since we introduced defining
  curl_off_t in system.h (7.55.0).
  
  Finally, this bumping logic is not present in the cmake build.

  Note the first one is GPL licensed but the author gave permission to
  waive that license for libcurl.
  
  As of right now this feature is disabled by default, and does not have
  a configure option to enable it. To enable this feature define
  ENABLE_SSLKEYLOGFILE when building libcurl and set environment
  variable SSLKEYLOGFILE to a pathname that will receive the keys.

- mime: remove support "-" stdin pseudo-file name in curl_mime_filedata().
  
  This feature is badly supported in Windows: as a replacement, a caller has
  to use curl_mime_data_cb() with fread, fseek and possibly fclose
  callbacks to process opened files.
  
  The cli tool and documentation are updated accordingly.
  
  The feature is however kept internally for form API compatibility, with
  the known caveats it always had.
  
  As a side effect, stdin size is not determined by the cli tool even if
  possible and this results in a chunked transfer encoding. Test 173 is
  updated accordingly.

  vtls: introduce curl_global_sslset()
  
  Let's add a compile time safe API to select an SSL backend. This
  function needs to be called *before* curl_global_init(), and can be
  called only once.
  
  Side note: we do not explicitly test that it is called before
  curl_global_init(), but we do verify that it is not called multiple times
  (even implicitly).
  
  If SSL is used before the function was called, it will use whatever the
  CURL_SSL_BACKEND environment variable says (or default to the first
  available SSL backend), and if a subsequent call to
  curl_global_sslset() disagrees with the previous choice, it will fail
  with CURLSSLSET_TOO_LATE.
  
  The function also accepts an "avail" parameter to point to a (read-only)
  NULL-terminated list of available backends. This comes in real handy if
  an application wants to let the user choose between whatever SSL backends
  the currently available libcurl has to offer: simply call
  
          curl_global_sslset(-1, NULL, &avail);
  
  which will return CURLSSLSET_UNKNOWN_BACKEND and populate the avail
  variable to point to the relevant information to present to the user.
  
  Just like with the HTTP/2 push functions, we have to add the function
  declaration of curl_global_sslset() function to the header file
  *multi.h* because VMS and OS/400 require a stable order of functions
  declared in include/curl/*.h (where the header files are sorted
  alphabetically). This looks a bit funny, but it cannot be helped.

  vtls: refactor out essential information about the SSL backends
  
  There is information about the compiled-in SSL backends that is really
  no concern of any code other than the SSL backend itself, such as which
  function (if any) implements SHA-256 summing.
  
  And there is information that is really interesting to the user, such as
  the name, or the curl_sslbackend value.
  
  Let's factor out the latter into a publicly visible struct. This
  information will be used in the upcoming API to set the SSL backend
  globally.

  vtls: allow selecting which SSL backend to use at runtime
  
  When building software for the masses, it is sometimes not possible to
  decide for all users which SSL backend is appropriate.
  
  Git for Windows, for example,  uses cURL to perform clones, fetches and
  pushes via HTTPS, and some users strongly prefer OpenSSL, while other
  users really need to use Secure Channel because it offers
  enterprise-ready tools to manage credentials via Windows' Credential
  Store.
  
  The current Git for Windows versions use the ugly work-around of
  building libcurl once with OpenSSL support and once with Secure Channel
  support, and switching out the binaries in the installer depending on
  the user's choice.
  
  Needless to say, this is a super ugly workaround that actually only
  works in some cases: Git for Windows also comes in a portable form, and
  in a form intended for third-party applications requiring Git
  functionality, in which cases this "swap out libcurl-4.dll" simply is
  not an option.
  
  Therefore, the Git for Windows project has a vested interest in teaching
  cURL to make the SSL backend a *runtime* option.
  
  This patch makes that possible.
  
  By running ./configure with multiple --with-<backend> options, cURL will
  be built with multiple backends.
  
  For the moment, the backend can be configured using the environment
  variable CURL_SSL_BACKEND (valid values are e.g. "openssl" and
  "schannel").

  vtls: encapsulate SSL backend-specific data
  
  So far, all of the SSL backends' private data has been declared as
  part of the ssl_connect_data struct, in one big #if .. #elif .. #endif
  block.
  
  This can only work as long as the SSL backend is a compile-time option,
  something we want to change in the next commits.
  
  Therefore, let's encapsulate the exact data needed by each SSL backend
  into a private struct, and let's avoid bleeding any SSL backend-specific
  information into urldata.h. This is also necessary to allow multiple SSL
  backends to be compiled in at the same time, as e.g. OpenSSL's and
  CyaSSL's headers cannot be included in the same .c file.
  
  To avoid too many malloc() calls, we simply append the private structs
  to the connectdata struct in allocate_conn().
  
  This requires us to take extra care of alignment issues: struct fields
  often need to be aligned on certain boundaries e.g. 32-bit values need to
  be stored at addresses that divide evenly by 4 (= 32 bit / 8
  bit-per-byte).
  
  We do that by assuming that no SSL backend's private data contains any
  fields that need to be aligned on boundaries larger than `long long`
  (typically 64-bit) would need. Under this assumption, we simply add a
  dummy field of type `long long` to the `struct connectdata` struct. This
  field will never be accessed but acts as a placeholder for the four
  instances of ssl_backend_data instead. the size of each ssl_backend_data
  struct is stored in the SSL backend-specific metadata, to allow
  allocate_conn() to know how much extra space to allocate, and how to
  initialize the ssl[sockindex]->backend and proxy_ssl[sockindex]->backend
  pointers.
  
  This would appear to be a little complicated at first, but is really
  necessary to encapsulate the private data of each SSL backend correctly.
  And we need to encapsulate thusly if we ever want to allow selecting
  CyaSSL and OpenSSL at runtime, as their headers cannot be included within
  the same .c file (there are just too many conflicting definitions and
  declarations for that).

  vtls: prepare the SSL backends for encapsulated private data
  
  At the moment, cURL's SSL backend needs to be configured at build time.
  As such, it is totally okay for them to hard-code their backend-specific
  data in the ssl_connect_data struct.
  
  In preparation for making the SSL backend a runtime option, let's make
  the access of said private data a bit more abstract so that it can be
  adjusted later in an easy manner.

  urldata.h: move SSPI-specific #include to correct location
  
  In 86b889485 (sasl_gssapi: Added GSS-API based Kerberos V5 variables,
  2014-12-03), an SSPI-specific field was added to the kerberos5data
  struct without moving the #include "curl_sspi.h" later in the same file.
  
  This broke the build when SSPI was enabled, unless Secure Channel was
  used as SSL backend, because it just so happens that Secure Channel also
  requires "curl_sspi.h" to be #included.
  
  In f4739f639 (urldata: include curl_sspi.h when Windows SSPI is enabled,
  2017-02-21), this bug was fixed incorrectly: Instead of moving the
  appropriate conditional #include, the Secure Channel-conditional part
  was now also SSPI-conditional.
  
  Fix this problem by moving the correct #include instead.
  
  This is also required for an upcoming patch that moves all the Secure
  Channel-specific stuff out of urldata.h and encapsulates it properly in
  vtls/schannel.c instead.

  configure: check for __builtin_available() availability (#1788)
  
  This change does two things:
  1. It un-breaks the build in Xcode 9.0. (Xcode 9.0 is currently
     failing trying to compile connectx() in lib/connect.c.)
  2. It finally weak-links the connectx() function, and falls back on
     connect() when run on older operating systems.

  progress: Track total times following redirects
  
  Update the progress timers `t_nslookup`, `t_connect`, `t_appconnect`,
  `t_pretransfer`, and `t_starttransfer` to track the total times for
  these activities when a redirect is followed. Previously, only the times
  for the most recent request would be tracked.
  
  Related changes:
  
    - Rename `Curl_pgrsResetTimesSizes` to `Curl_pgrsResetTransferSizes`
      now that the function only resets transfer sizes and no longer
      modifies any of the progress timers.
  
    - Add a bool to the `Progress` struct that is used to prevent
      double-counting `t_starttransfer` times.
  
  Added test case 1399.

  curl/system.h: support more architectures
  
  The long list of architectures in include/curl/system.h is annoying to
  maintain, and needs to be extended for each and every architecture to
  support.
  
  Instead, let's rely on the __SIZEOF_LONG__ define of the gcc compiler
  (we are in the GNUC condition anyway), which tells us if long is 4
  bytes or 8 bytes.
  
  This fixes the build of libcurl 7.55.0 on architectures such as
  OpenRISC or ARC.

  curl: do bounds check using a double comparison
  
  The fix for this in 8661a0aacc01492e0436275ff36a21734f2541bb wasn't
  complete: if the parsed number in num is larger than will fit in a long,
  the conversion is undefined behaviour (causing test1427 to fail for me
  on IA32 with GCC 7.1, although it passes on AMD64 and ARMv7).  Getting
  rid of the cast means the comparison will be done using doubles.
  
  It might make more sense for the max argument to also be a double...

  multi: fix request timer management
  
  There are some bugs in how timers are managed for a single easy handle
  that causes the wrong "next timeout" value to be reported to the
  application when a new minimum needs to be recomputed and that new
  minimum should be an existing timer that isn't currently set for the
  easy handle.  When the application drives a set of easy handles via the
  `curl_multi_socket_action()` API (for example), it gets told to wait the
  wrong amount of time before the next call, which causes requests to
  linger for a long time (or, it is my guess, possibly forever).

- rtspd: fix GCC warning after MSVC warning fix
  
  Older GCC warns:
  /tests/server/rtspd.c:1194:10: warning: missing braces around
  initializer [-Wmissing-braces]
  
  Fix this by using memset instead of an initializer.

- libtest: fix MSVC warning C4706
  
  With warning level 4, MSVC warns about assignments within conditional
  expressions. Change the while loop to a do-while loop to fix this. This
  change is also consistent with CODE_STYLE.md.

- sockfilt: suppress conversion warning with explicit cast
  
  MSVC warns when implicitly casting -1 to unsigned long.

- rtspd: fix MSVC level 4 warning
  
  warning C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'req' used

- winbuild: re-enable warning C4127 for curl tool
  
  Disabled in cda19a345f6970e22fe8b7a808aeb8f086a21eac. It only needs to
  be disabled for libcurl.

- winbuild: build with warning level 4
  
  This is consistent with 7bc64561a2e63ca93e4b0b31d350773ba80955c2, which
  changed the warning level from 3 to 4 for the Visual Studio project
  files. But disable the level 4 warning C4127 "conditional expression is
  constant", as that one is issued by older versions of the Windows SDK
  as well as curl itself under some circumstances.

  This is a follow-up to af02162 which removed (SET_)ERRNO macros. That

- ldap: fix MinGW compiler warning
  
  ldap_bind_s is marked as deprecated in w32api's winldap.h shipping with

  f0fe66f13c93d3d0af45d9fb1231c9164e0f9dc8. Fix this for the non-SSPI

- curl-compilers.m4: disable warning spam with Cygwin's clang
  
  When building with Cygwin or MinGW, libtool uses a wrapper executable
  instead of a wrapper script [1], which is written in C and throws
  missing-variable-declarations warnings. Don't enable these warnings on
  Cygwin and MinGW in order to avoid warnings for every executable built,
  which spams the test suite output when using Cygwin's clang.

- curl_setup_once: Remove ERRNO/SET_ERRNO macros
  
  Prior to this change (SET_)ERRNO mapped to GetLastError/SetLastError
  for Win32 and regular errno otherwise.
  
  I reviewed the code and found no justifiable reason for conflating errno
  on WIN32 with GetLastError/SetLastError. All Win32 CRTs support errno,
  and any Win32 multithreaded CRT supports thread-local errno.

  gtls: fix build when sizeof(long) < sizeof(void *)
  
  - Change gnutls pointer/int macros to pointer/curl_socket_t.
    Prior to this change they used long type as well.
  
  The size of the `long` data type can be shorter than that of pointer
  types. This is the case most notably on Windows.
  
  If C99 were acceptable, we could simply use `intptr_t` here. But we
  want to retain C89 compatibility.
  
  Simply use the trick of performing pointer arithmetic with the NULL
  pointer: to convert an integer `i` to a pointer, simply take the
  address of the `i`th element of a hypothetical character array
  starting at address NULL. To convert back, simply cast the pointer
  difference.
  
  Thanks to Jay Satiro for the initial modification to use curl_socket_t
  instead of int/long.

- curl --socks5-{basic,gssapi}: control socks5 auth
  
  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1454

- CURLOPT_SOCKS5_AUTH: allowed methods for SOCKS5 proxy auth
  
  If libcurl was built with GSS-API support, it unconditionally advertised
  GSS-API authentication while connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy.  This caused
  problems in environments with improperly configured Kerberos: a stock
  libcurl failed to connect, despite libcurl built without GSS-API
  connected fine using username and password.
  
  This commit introduces the CURLOPT_SOCKS5_AUTH option to control the
  allowed methods for SOCKS5 authentication at run time.
  
  Note that a new option was preferred over reusing CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH
  for compatibility reasons because the set of authentication methods
  allowed by default was different for HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies.

- curl-compilers.m4: fix unknown-warning-option on Apple clang
  
  Since 5598b0bd63f690c151074494ce47ef872f004ab4, clang -v is used to
  detect the clang version. The version number was expected to come after
  the word "version". For Apple clang, this doesn't work as it has its
  own versioning scheme.
  The version number is now first searched after the string
  "based on LLVM". This works for Apple clang before version 7, and also
  for e.g. Ubuntu's clang up to version 3.7. If it's not found and the
  version string contains "Apple LLVM version", clang version 3.7 is
  assumed, which is the version that comes with Xcode 7. Otherwise, the
  version number is still expected after the word "version", which works
  for very old Apple clang versions.

  Closes #1546

- tests: stabilize test 2032 and 2033
  
  Both these tests run the same underlying test code: libntlmconnect.c -
  this test code made some assumptions about socket ordering when it used
  curl_easy_fdset() and when we changed timing or got accidental changes
  in libcurl the tests would fail.
  
  The tests verify that the different transfers keep using the same
  connections, which I now instead made sure by adding the number of bytes
  each transfer gets and then verifies that they always get the same
  amount as when these tests worked.

- lib/curl_setup.h: remove CURL_WANTS_CA_BUNDLE_ENV
  
  When this define was set, libcurl would check the environment variable
  named CURL_CA_BUNDLE at run-time and use that CA cert bundle. This
  feature was only defined by the watcom and m32 makefiles and caused
  inconsistent behaviours among libcurls built on different platforms.
  
  The curl tool does already feature its own similar logic and the library
  does not really need it, and it isn't documented libcurl behavior. So
  this change removes it.

- timers: store internal time stamps as time_t instead of doubles
  
  This gives us accurate precision and it allows us to avoid storing "no
  time" for systems with too low timer resolution as we then bump the time
  up to 1 microsecond. Should fix test 573 on windows.
  
  Remove the now unused curlx_tvdiff_secs() function.
  
  Maintains the external getinfo() API with using doubles.
  
  Fixes #1531

- dist: make the hugehelp.c not get regenerated unnecessarily
  
  The maketgz script now makes sure the generated hugehelp.c file in the
  tarball is newer than the generated curl.1 man page, so that it doesn't
  have to get unnecessarily rebuilt first thing in a typical build. It
  thus also removes the need for perl to build off a plain release
  tarball.

- asyn-ares: s/Curl_expire_latest/Curl_expire

- expire: remove Curl_expire_latest()
  
  With the introduction of expire IDs and the fact that existing timers
  can be removed now and thus never expire, the concept with adding a
  "latest" timer is not working anymore as it risks to not expire at all.
  
  So, to be certain the timers actually are in line and will expire, the
  plain Curl_expire() needs to be used. The _latest() function was added
  as a sort of shortcut in the past that's quite simply not necessary
  anymore.

  Also removed a TODO suggesting caching the precheck results. Tests

  relatively modern system, an unnoticeable gain at the cost of longer and
  more complicated code. There would also be a danger that a cached test
  result would be inappropriately returned, such as when other test
  dependencies (like environment variables) are different or when the
  precheck causes side effects (like filesystem changes).

- configure: fix the -ldl check for openssl, add -lpthread check
  
  The check for if -ldl is needed to build with (a statically built)
  openssl was broken. This repairs the check, and adds a check for
  -lpthread as well since OpenSSL 1.1.0+ does in fact require -lpthread so
  only adding -ldl for a static openssl build is no longer enough.

  - Track when the cached encrypted data contains only a partial record
    that can't be decrypted without more data (SEC_E_INCOMPLETE_MESSAGE).

  multi: clarify condition in curl_multi_wait
  
  `if(nfds || extra_nfds) {` is followed by `malloc(nfds * ...)`.
  
  If `extra_fs` could be non-zero when `nfds` was zero, then we have
  `malloc(0)` which is allowed to return `NULL`. But, malloc returning
  NULL can be confusing. In this code, the next line would treat the NULL
  as an allocation failure.
  
  It turns out, if `nfds` is zero then `extra_nfds` must also be zero.
  The final value of `nfds` includes `extra_nfds`.  So the test for
  `extra_nfds` is redundant.  It can only confuse the reader.

- typecheck-gcc: handle function pointers properly
  
  All the callbacks passed to curl_easy_setopt are defined as function
  pointers. The possibility to pass both functions and function pointers
  was handled for the callbacks that typecheck-gcc.h defined as
  compatible, but not for the public callback types themselves.
  
  This makes all compatible callback types defined in typecheck-gcc.h
  function pointers too and checks all functions uniformly with
  _curl_callback_compatible, which handles both functions and function
  pointers.
  
  A symptom of the problem was a warning in tool_operate.c with
  --disable-libcurl-option and without --enable-debug as that file
  passes the callback functions to curl_easy_setopt directly.

- nss: fix MinGW compiler warnings
  
  This fixes 3 warnings issued by MinGW:
  1. PR_ImportTCPSocket actually has a paramter of type PROsfd instead of
  PRInt32, which is 64 bits on Windows. Fixed this by including the
  corresponding header file instead of redeclaring the function, which is
  supported even though it is in the private include folder. [1]
  2. In 64-bit mode, size_t is 64 bits while CK_ULONG is 32 bits, so an explicit
  narrowing cast is needed.
  3. Curl_timeleft returns time_t instead of long since commit
  21aa32d30dbf319f2d336e0cb68d3a3235869fbb.

  openssl: fix thread-safety bugs in error-handling
  
  ERR_error_string with NULL parameter is not thread-safe. The library
  writes the string into some static buffer. Two threads doing this at
  once may clobber each other and run into problems. Switch to
  ERR_error_string_n which avoids this problem and is explicitly
  bounds-checked.
  
  Also clean up some remnants of OpenSSL 0.9.5 around here. A number of
  comments (fixed buffer size, explaining that ERR_error_string_n was
  added in a particular version) date to when ossl_strerror tried to
  support pre-ERR_error_string_n OpenSSLs.

  multi: fix queueing of pending easy handles
  
  Multi handles repeatedly invert the queue of pending easy handles when

  process involving Curl_splaygetbest and violates the FIFO property of
  the multi handle.
  This patch fixes this issue by redefining the "best" node in the
  context of timeouts as the "smallest not larger than now", and
  implementing the necessary data structure modifications to do this
  effectively, namely:
   - splay nodes with the same key are now stored in a doubly-linked
     circular list instead of a non-circular one to enable O(1)
     insertion to the tail of the list
   - Curl_splayinsert inserts nodes with the same key to the tail of
     the same list
   - in case of multiple nodes with the same key, the one on the head of
     the list gets selected
