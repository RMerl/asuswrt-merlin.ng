Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active
FTP transfers. Curl normally first attempts to use EPRT before using PORT, but
with this option, it uses PORT right away. EPRT is an extension to the
original FTP protocol, and does not work on all servers, but enables more
functionality in a better way than the traditional PORT command.

--eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt is an alias
for --disable-eprt.

If the server is accessed using IPv6, this option has no effect as EPRT is
necessary then.

Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want to switch to
passive mode you need to not use --ftp-port or force it with --ftp-pasv.
