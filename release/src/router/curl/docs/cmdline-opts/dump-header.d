Write the received protocol headers to the specified file. If no headers are
received, the use of this option creates an empty file.

When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered being "headers"
and thus are saved there.

Having multiple transfers in one set of operations (i.e. the URLs in one
--next clause), appends them to the same file, separated by a blank line.
