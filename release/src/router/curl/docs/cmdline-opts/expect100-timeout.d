Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a 100-continue
response when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue header in its request. By
default curl waits one second. This option accepts decimal values! When
curl stops waiting, it continues as if the response has been received.

The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not
the local version even if it might be using another separator.
