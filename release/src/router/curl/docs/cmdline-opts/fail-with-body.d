Return an error on server errors where the HTTP response code is 400 or
greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it
returns an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why and
more). This flag allows curl to output and save that content but also to
return error 22.

This is an alternative option to --fail which makes curl fail for the same
circumstances but without saving the content.
