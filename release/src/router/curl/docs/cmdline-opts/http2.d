Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

For HTTPS, this means curl negotiates HTTP/2 in the TLS handshake. curl does
this by default.

For HTTP, this means curl attempts to upgrade the request to HTTP/2 using the
Upgrade: request header.

When curl uses HTTP/2 over HTTPS, it does not itself insist on TLS 1.2 or
higher even though that is required by the specification. A user can add this
version requirement with --tlsv1.2.
