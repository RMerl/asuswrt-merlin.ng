Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

For HTTPS, this means curl will attempt to negotiate HTTP/2 in the TLS
handshake. curl does this by default.

For HTTP, this means curl will attempt to upgrade the request to HTTP/2 using
the Upgrade: request header.

When curl uses HTTP/2 over HTTPS, it does not itself insist on TLS 1.2 or
higher even though that is required by the specification. A user can add this
version requirement with --tlsv1.2.
