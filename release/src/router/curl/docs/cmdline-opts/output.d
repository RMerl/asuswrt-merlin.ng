Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch
multiple documents, you should quote the URL and you can use '#' followed by a
number in the <file> specifier. That variable is replaced with the current
string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

 curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"

or use several variables like:

 curl "http://{site,host}.host[1-5].example" -o "#1_#2"

You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have. For
example, if you specify two URLs on the same command line, you can use it like
this:

 curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

and the order of the -o options and the URLs does not matter, just that the
first -o is for the first URL and so on, so the above command line can also be
written as

 curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

See also the --create-dirs option to create the local directories
dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash) passes the output to
stdout.

To suppress response bodies, you can redirect output to /dev/null:

 curl example.com -o /dev/null

Or for Windows:

 curl example.com -o nul
