This option tells the --remote-name option to use the server-specified
Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a filename from the URL. If
the server-provided file name contains a path, that is stripped off before the
file name is used.

The file is saved in the current directory, or in the directory specified with
--output-dir.

If the server specifies a file name and a file with that name already exists
in the destination directory, it is not overwritten and an error occurs -
unless you allow it by using the --clobber option. If the server does not
specify a file name then this option has no effect.

There is no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided file name, so
this option may provide you with rather unexpected file names.

This feature uses the name from the "filename" field, it does not yet support
the "filename*" field (filenames with explicit character sets).

**WARNING**: Exercise judicious use of this option, especially on Windows. A
rogue server could send you the name of a DLL or other file that could be
loaded automatically by Windows or some third party software.
