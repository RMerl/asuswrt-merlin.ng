The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Retries are done
as usual (see --retry) as long as the timer has not reached this given
limit. Notice that if the timer has not reached the limit, the request is
made and while performing, it may take longer than this given time period. To
limit a single request's maximum time, use --max-time. Set this option to zero
to not timeout retries.
