Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host name locally. If the
port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

To specify proxy on a unix domain socket, use localhost for host, e.g.
socks5://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

This option overrides any previous use of --proxy, as they are mutually
exclusive.

This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5 proxy with --proxy
using a socks5:// protocol prefix. (Added in 7.21.7)

--preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at the same time --proxy is
used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy (added in 7.52.0). In such a case, curl first
connects to the SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or
HTTPS proxy.

This option (as well as --socks4) does not work with IPV6, FTPS or LDAP.
