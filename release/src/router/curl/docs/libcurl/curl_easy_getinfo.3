.IP NAMELOOKUP
\fICURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME(3)\fP and \fICURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME_T(3)\fP.
The time it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
.IP CONNECT
\fICURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME(3)\fP and \fICURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME_T(3)\fP.  The time
it took from the start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was
completed.
.IP APPCONNECT
\fICURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME(3)\fP and \fICURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME_T(3)\fP.
The time it took from the start until the SSL connect/handshake with the
remote host was completed. (Added in 7.19.0) The latter is the integer version
(measuring microseconds). (Added in 7.60.0)
.IP PRETRANSFER
\fICURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME(3)\fP and \fICURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T(3)\fP.
The time it took from the start until the file transfer is just about to
begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are
specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
.IP STARTTRANSFER
\fICURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME(3)\fP and
\fICURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME_T(3)\fP. The time it took from the start until
the first byte is received by libcurl.
.IP TOTAL
\fICURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME(3)\fP and \fICURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME_T(3)\fP. Total time
of the previous request.
.IP REDIRECT
\fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME(3)\fP and \fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME_T(3)\fP. The
time it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect,
pretransfer and transfer before final transaction was started. So, this is
zero if no redirection took place.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
  curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://www.example.com/");
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

      char *ct;
      /* ask for the content-type */
      res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE, &ct);

      if((CURLE_OK == res) && ct)
        printf("We received Content-Type: %s\\n", ct);
    }

    /* always cleanup */
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.4.1
.SH RETURN VALUE
