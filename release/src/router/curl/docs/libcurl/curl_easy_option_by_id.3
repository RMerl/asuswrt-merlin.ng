.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

const struct curl_easyoption *curl_easy_option_by_id(CURLoption id);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a \fICURLoption\fP \fBid\fP, this function returns a pointer to the
\fIcurl_easyoption\fP struct, holding information about the
\fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP option using that id. The option id is the CURLOPT_
prefix ones provided in the standard curl/curl.h header file. This function
returns the non-alias version of the cases where there is an alias function as
well.

If libcurl has no option with the given id, this function returns NULL.

const struct curl_easyoption *opt = curl_easy_option_by_id(CURLOPT_URL);
if(opt) {
  printf("This option wants type %x\\n", opt->type);
}
.fi
