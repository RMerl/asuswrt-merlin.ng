.TH curl_escape 3 "May 17, 2022" "libcurl 7.84.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_escape - URL encodes the given string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

char *curl_escape(const char *url, int length);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Obsolete function. Use \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP instead!

This function will convert the given input string to an URL encoded string and
return that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not a-z,
A-Z or 0-9 will be converted to their "URL escaped" version (%NN where NN is a
two-digit hexadecimal number).

If the \fBlengthf\fP argument is set to 0, curl_escape() will use strlen() on
the input \fBurl\fP string to find out the size.

You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you are done with it.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
char *output = curl_escape("data to convert", 15);
if(output) {
  printf("Encoded: %s\\n", output);
  curl_free(output);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Since 7.15.4, \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP should be used. This function will
be removed in a future release.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A pointer to a null-terminated string or NULL if it failed.
