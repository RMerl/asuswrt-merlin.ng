.TH curl_escape 3 "September 26, 2023" "libcurl 8.4.0" "libcurl"

.SH NAME
curl_escape - URL encodes the given string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

char *curl_escape(const char *string, int length);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Obsolete function. Use \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP instead!

This function converts the given input \fBstring\fP to a URL encoded string
and return that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not
a-z, A-Z or 0-9 are converted to their "URL escaped" version (\fB%NN\fP where
\fBNN\fP is a two-digit hexadecimal number).

If the \fBlength\fP argument is set to 0, \fIcurl_escape(3)\fP uses strlen()
on \fBstring\fP to find out the size.

You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you are done with it.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
char *output = curl_escape("data to convert", 15);
if(output) {
  printf("Encoded: %s\\n", output);
  curl_free(output);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Since 7.15.4, \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP should be used. This function might be
removed in a future release.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A pointer to a null-terminated string or NULL if it failed.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR curl_unescape (3),
.BR curl_free (3)
