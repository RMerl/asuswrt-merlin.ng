.TH curl_formfree 3 "May 17, 2022" "libcurl 7.84.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_formfree - free a previously build multipart/formdata HTTP POST chain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

void curl_formfree(struct curl_httppost *form);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is deprecated. Do not use. See \fIcurl_mime_init(3)\fP instead!

curl_formfree() is used to clean up data previously built/appended with
\fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP. This must be called when the data has been used, which
typically means after \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP has been called.

The pointer to free is the same pointer you passed to the
\fICURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)\fP option, which is the \fIfirstitem\fP pointer from
the \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP invoke(s).

\fBform\fP is the pointer as returned from a previous call to
\fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP and may be NULL.

Passing in a NULL pointer in \fIform\fP will make this function return
immediately with no action.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
  /* Fill in a file upload field */
  curl_formadd(&formpost,
               &lastptr,
               CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "file",
               CURLFORM_FILE, "nice-image.jpg",
               CURLFORM_END);

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPPOST, formpost);

  curl_easy_perform(curl);

  /* then cleanup the formpost chain */
  curl_formfree(formpost);
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Deprecated in 7.56.0.

None
