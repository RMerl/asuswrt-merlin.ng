.TH curl_getenv 3 "March 02, 2020" "libcurl 7.69.1" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_getenv - return value for environment name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "char *curl_getenv(const char *" name ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_getenv() is a portable wrapper for the getenv() function, meant to
emulate its behaviour and provide an identical interface for all operating
systems libcurl builds on (including win32).

You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you're done with it.
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function will be removed from the public libcurl API in a near future. It
will instead be made "available" by source code access only, and then as
curlx_getenv().
.SH RETURN VALUE
A pointer to a zero terminated string or NULL if it failed to find the
specified name.
.SH NOTE
Under unix operating systems, there isn't any point in returning an allocated
memory, although other systems won't work properly if this isn't done. The
unix implementation thus has to suffer slightly from the drawbacks of other
systems.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR getenv "(3C), "
