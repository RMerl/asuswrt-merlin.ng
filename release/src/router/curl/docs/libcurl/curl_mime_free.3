.TH curl_mime_free 3 "September 26, 2023" "libcurl 8.4.0" "libcurl"

.SH NAME
curl_mime_free - free a previously built mime structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

void curl_mime_free(curl_mime *mime);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_free(3)\fP is used to clean up data previously built/appended
with \fIcurl_mime_addpart(3)\fP and other mime-handling functions. This must
be called when the data has been used, which typically means after
\fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP has been called.

The handle to free is the one you passed to the \fICURLOPT_MIMEPOST(3)\fP
option: attached sub part mime structures must not be explicitly freed as they
are by the top structure freeing.

\fBmime\fP is the handle as returned from a previous call to
\fIcurl_mime_init(3)\fP and may be NULL.

Passing in a NULL pointer in \fImime\fP makes this function return immediately
with no action.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
  /* Build the mime message. */
  mime = curl_mime_init(curl);

  /* ... */

  /* Free multipart message. */
  curl_mime_free(mime);
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY

.SH RETURN VALUE
None
