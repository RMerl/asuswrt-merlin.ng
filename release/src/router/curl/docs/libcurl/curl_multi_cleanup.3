.TH curl_multi_cleanup 3 "May 17, 2022" "libcurl 7.84.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_multi_cleanup - close down a multi session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_cleanup(CURLM *multi_handle);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Cleans up and removes a whole multi stack. It does not free or touch any
individual easy handles in any way - they still need to be closed
individually, using the usual \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP way. The order of
cleaning up should be:

1 - \fIcurl_multi_remove_handle(3)\fP before any easy handles are cleaned up

2 - \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP can now be called independently since the easy
handle is no longer connected to the multi handle

3 - \fIcurl_multi_cleanup(3)\fP should be called when all easy handles are
removed

Passing in a NULL pointer in \fImulti_handle\fP will make this function return
CURLM_BAD_HANDLE immediately with no other action.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 /* when the multi transfer is done ... */

 /* remove all easy handles, then: */
 curl_multi_cleanup(multi_handle);
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.9.6
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code. On success,
CURLM_OK is returned.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
