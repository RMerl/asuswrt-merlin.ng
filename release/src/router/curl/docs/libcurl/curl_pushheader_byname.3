.TH curl_pushheader_byname 3 "September 26, 2023" "libcurl 8.4.0" "libcurl"

.SH NAME
curl_pushheader_byname - get a push header by name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

char *curl_pushheader_byname(struct curl_pushheaders *h, const char *name);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a function that is only functional within a
\fICURLMOPT_PUSHFUNCTION(3)\fP callback. It makes no sense to try to use it
elsewhere and it has no function then.

It returns the value for the given header field name (or NULL) for the
incoming server push request. This is a shortcut so that the application does
not have to loop through all headers to find the one it is interested in. The
data this function points to is freed when this callback returns. If more than
one header field use the same name, this returns only the first one.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int curl_push_callback(CURL *parent,
                       CURL *easy,
                       size_t num_headers,
                       struct curl_pushheaders *headers,
                       void *clientp)
{
  char *headp;
  int *transfers = (int *)clientp;
  FILE *out;
  headp = curl_pushheader_byname(headers, ":path");
  if(headp && !strncmp(headp, "/push-", 6)) {
    fprintf(stderr, "The PATH is %s\\n", headp);

    /* save the push here */
    out = fopen("pushed-stream", "wb");

    /* write to this file */
    curl_easy_setopt(easy, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, out);

    (*transfers)++; /* one more */

    return CURL_PUSH_OK;
  }
  return CURL_PUSH_DENY;
}

curl_multi_setopt(multi, CURLMOPT_PUSHFUNCTION, curl_push_callback);
curl_multi_setopt(multi, CURLMOPT_PUSHDATA, &counter);
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
