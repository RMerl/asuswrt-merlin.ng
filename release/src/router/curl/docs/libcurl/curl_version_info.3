.TH curl_version_info 3 "September 27, 2023" "libcurl 8.4.0" "libcurl"

.SH NAME
curl_version_info - returns runtime libcurl version info
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

curl_version_info_data *curl_version_info(CURLversion age);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Returns a pointer to a filled in static struct with information about various
features in the running version of libcurl. \fIage\fP should be set to the
version of this functionality by the time you write your program. This way,
libcurl always returns a proper struct that your program understands, while
programs in the future might get a different struct. \fBCURLVERSION_NOW\fP is
the most recent one for the library you have installed:
.nf
  data = curl_version_info(CURLVERSION_NOW);
.fi
Applications should use this information to judge if things are possible to do
or not, instead of using compile-time checks, as dynamic/DLL libraries can be
changed independent of applications.

This function can alter the returned static data as long as
\fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP has not been called. It is therefore not thread-safe
before libcurl initialization occurs.

The curl_version_info_data struct looks like this

.nf
typedef struct {
  CURLversion age;          /* see description below */

  const char *version;      /* human readable string */
  unsigned int version_num; /* numeric representation */

  const char *quic_version;    /* human readable quic (+ HTTP/3) library +

                                  be NULL */

  unsigned int zstd_ver_num; /* Numeric Zstd version
                                  (MAJOR << 24) | (MINOR << 12) | PATCH */

\fIage\fP describes what the age of this struct is. The number depends on how
new the libcurl you are using is. You are however guaranteed to get a struct
that you have a matching struct for in the header, as you tell libcurl your
"age" with the input argument.

\fIversion\fP is just an ascii string for the libcurl version.

\fIversion_num\fP is a 24 bit number created like this: <8 bits major number>
| <8 bits minor number> | <8 bits patch number>. Version 7.9.8 is therefore
returned as 0x070908.

\fIhost\fP is an ascii string showing what host information that this libcurl
was built for. As discovered by a configure script or set by the build
environment.

\fIfeatures\fP is a bit mask representing available features. It can
have none, one or more bits set.
The use of this field is deprecated: use \fIfeature_names\fP instead.
The feature names description below lists the associated bits.

\fIfeature_names\fP is a pointer to an array of string pointers, containing the
names of the features that libcurl supports. The array is terminated by a NULL
entry. Currently defined names are:

.RE

\fIssl_version\fP is an ASCII string for the TLS library name + version
used. If libcurl has no SSL support, this is NULL. For example "Schannel",
\&"Secure Transport" or "OpenSSL/1.1.0g".

\fIssl_version_num\fP is always 0.

\fIlibz_version\fP is an ASCII string (there is no numerical version). If
libcurl has no libz support, this is NULL.

\fIprotocols\fP is a pointer to an array of char * pointers, containing the
names protocols that libcurl supports (using lowercase letters). The protocol
names are the same as would be used in URLs. The array is terminated by a NULL
entry.
