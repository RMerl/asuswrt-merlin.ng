.TH CURLINFO_CAINFO 3 "September 26, 2023" "libcurl 8.4.0" "libcurl"

.SH NAME
CURLINFO_CAINFO \- get the default built-in CA certificate path
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_CAINFO, char **path);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the pointer to a null-terminated
string holding the default built-in path used for the \fICURLOPT_CAINFO(3)\fP
option unless set by the user.

Note that in a situation where libcurl has been built to support multiple TLS
libraries, this option might return a string even if the specific TLS library
currently set to be used does not support \fICURLOPT_CAINFO(3)\fP.

This is a path identifying a single file containing CA certificates.

The \fBpath\fP pointer is set to NULL if there is no default path.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {

  char *cainfo = NULL;

  if(cainfo)
      printf("default ca info path: %s\\n", cainfo);
  }
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
