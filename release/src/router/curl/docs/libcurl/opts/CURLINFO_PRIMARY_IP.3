.TH CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP \- get IP address of last connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP, char **ip);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the pointer to a null-terminated
string holding the IP address of the most recent connection done with this
\fBcurl\fP handle. This string may be IPv6 when that is enabled. Note that you
get a pointer to a memory area that is reused at next request so you need to
copy the string if you want to keep the information.

The \fBip\fP pointer is NULL or points to private memory. You MUST NOT free -
it gets freed when you call \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP on the corresponding
CURL handle.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All network based ones
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
{
  char *ip;

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

  /* Perform the transfer */
  res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  /* Check for errors */
  if((res == CURLE_OK) &&
     !curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP, &ip) && ip) {
    printf("IP: %s\\n", ip);
  }

  /* always cleanup */
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
