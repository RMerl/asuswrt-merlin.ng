.TH CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION \- get TLS session info
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION,
                           struct curl_tlssessioninfo **session);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBThis option has been superseded\fP by \fICURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR(3)\fP which
was added in 7.48.0. The only reason you would use this option instead is if
you could be using a version of libcurl earlier than 7.48.0.

This option is exactly the same as \fICURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR(3)\fP except in the
case of OpenSSL. If the session \fIbackend\fP is CURLSSLBACKEND_OPENSSL the
session \fIinternals\fP pointer varies depending on the option:

\fICURLINFO_TLS_SESSION(3)\fP OpenSSL session \fIinternals\fP is \fBSSL_CTX *\fP.

\fICURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR(3)\fP OpenSSL session \fIinternals\fP is \fBSSL *\fP.

You can obtain an \fBSSL_CTX\fP pointer from an SSL pointer using OpenSSL
function \fISSL_get_SSL_CTX(3)\fP. Therefore unless you need compatibility
with older versions of libcurl use \fICURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR(3)\fP. Refer to
that document for more information.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS-based
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  CURLcode res;
  struct curl_tlssessioninfo *tls;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
  res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION, &tls);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.34.0. Deprecated since 7.48.0 and supported OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and
NSS only up until this version was released.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.

.BR curl_easy_setopt (3),
