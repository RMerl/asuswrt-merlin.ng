.TH CURLOPT_ABSTRACT_UNIX_SOCKET 3 "May 17, 2022" "libcurl 7.84.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_ABSTRACT_UNIX_SOCKET \- abstract Unix domain socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_ABSTRACT_UNIX_SOCKET,
                          char *path);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Enables the use of an abstract Unix domain socket instead of establishing a
TCP connection to a host. The parameter should be a char * to a
null-terminated string holding the path of the socket. The path will be set to
\fIpath\fP prefixed by a NULL byte (this is the convention for abstract
sockets, however it should be stressed that the path passed to this function
should not contain a leading NULL).

On non-supporting platforms, the abstract address will be interpreted as an
empty string and fail gracefully, generating a runtime error.

This option shares the same semantics as \fICURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH(3)\fP in
which documentation more details can be found. Internally, these two options
share the same storage and therefore only one of them can be set per handle.
.SH DEFAULT
Default is NULL.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
  curl_easy_setopt(curl_handle, CURLOPT_ABSTRACT_UNIX_SOCKET, "/tmp/foo.sock");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl_handle, CURLOPT_URL, "http://localhost/");
.fi

.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.53.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH "(3), " unix "(7), "
