.TH CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB 3 "May 17, 2022" "libcurl 7.84.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB \- Certificate Authority (CA) bundle in PEM format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB,
                          struct curl_blob *stblob);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a curl_blob structure, which contains information (pointer
and size) about a memory block with binary data of PEM encoded content holding
one or more certificates to verify the HTTPS server with.

If \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)\fP is zero and you avoid verifying the
server's certificate, \fICURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB(3)\fP is not needed.

This option overrides \fICURLOPT_CAINFO(3)\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
char *strpem; /* strpem must point to a PEM string */
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  struct curl_blob blob;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  blob.data = strpem;
  blob.len = strlen(strpem);
  blob.flags = CURL_BLOB_COPY;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB, &blob);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.77.0.

This option is supported by the BearSSL (since 7.79.0), mbedTLS (since 7.81.0),
rustls (since 7.82.0), OpenSSL, Secure Transport and Schannel backends.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
