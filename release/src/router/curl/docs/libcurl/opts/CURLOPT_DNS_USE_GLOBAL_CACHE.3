.TH CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE \- global DNS cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE,
                          long enable);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Has no function since 7.62.0. Do not use!

Pass a long. If the \fIenable\fP value is 1, it tells curl to use a global DNS
cache that survives between easy handle creations and deletions. This is not
thread-safe and this uses a global variable.

See \fICURLOPT_SHARE(3)\fP and \fIcurl_share_init(3)\fP for the correct way to
share DNS cache between transfers.
.SH DEFAULT
0
.SH PROTOCOLS
All

  /* switch off the use of a global, thread unsafe, cache */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE, 0L);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
