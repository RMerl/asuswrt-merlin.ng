CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET, "/var/egd.socket");
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
If built with TLS enabled. Only the OpenSSL backend will use this, and only
with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0.
