.TH CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT \- force a new connection to be used
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT, long fresh);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. Set to 1 to make the next transfer use a new (fresh) connection
by force instead of trying to reuse an existing one. This option should be
used with caution and only if you understand what it does as it may impact
performance negatively.

Related functionality is \fICURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE(3)\fP which makes sure the
connection is closed after use so that it cannot be reused.

Set \fIfresh\fP to 0 to have libcurl attempt reusing an existing connection
(default behavior).
.SH DEFAULT
0
