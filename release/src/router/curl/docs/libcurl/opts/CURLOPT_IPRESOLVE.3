.TH CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE \- IP protocol version to use
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE, long resolve);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Allows an application to select what kind of IP addresses to use when
establishing a connection or choosing one from the connection pool. This is
interesting when using host names that resolve to more than one IP family.

If the URL provided for a transfer contains a numerical IP version as a host
name, this option does not override or prohibit libcurl from using that IP
version.

Available values for this option are:
.IP CURL_IPRESOLVE_WHATEVER
Default, can use addresses of all IP versions that your system allows.
.IP CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4
Uses only IPv4 addresses.
.IP CURL_IPRESOLVE_V6
Uses only IPv6 addresses.
.SH DEFAULT
CURL_IPRESOLVE_WHATEVER
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE

CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");

  /* of all addresses example.com resolves to, only IPv6 ones are used */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE, CURL_IPRESOLVE_V6);
