.TH CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT_ALLOWFAILS 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT_ALLOWFAILS \- allow RCPT TO command to fail for some recipients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT_ALLOWFAILS,
                          long allow);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If \fIallow\fP is set to 1L, allow RCPT TO command to fail for some recipients.

When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl aborts the SMTP
conversation if either one of the recipients causes the RCPT TO command to
return an error.

The default behavior can be changed by setting \fIallow\fP to 1L which makes
libcurl ignore errors for individual recipients and proceed with the remaining
accepted recipients.

If all recipients trigger RCPT TO failures and this flag is specified, curl
aborts the SMTP conversation and returns the error received from to the last
RCPT TO command.
.SH DEFAULT
0
.SH PROTOCOLS
SMTP
