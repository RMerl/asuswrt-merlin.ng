.TH CURLOPT_MAXLIFETIME_CONN 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXLIFETIME_CONN \- max lifetime (since creation) allowed for reusing a connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXLIFETIME_CONN,
                          long maxlifetime);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long as parameter containing \fImaxlifetime\fP - the maximum time in
seconds, since the creation of the connection, that you allow an existing
connection to have to be considered for reuse for this request.

libcurl features a connection cache that holds previously used connections.
When a new request is to be done, libcurl considers any connection that
matches for reuse. The \fICURLOPT_MAXLIFETIME_CONN(3)\fP limit prevents
libcurl from trying too old connections for reuse. This can be used for
client-side load balancing. If a connection is found in the cache that is
older than this set \fImaxlifetime\fP, it is instead marked for closure.

If set to 0, this behavior is disabled: all connections are eligible for reuse.
.SH DEFAULT
Default \fImaxlifetime\fP is 0 seconds (i.e., disabled).
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

  /* only allow each connection to be reused for 30 seconds */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXLIFETIME_CONN, 30L);

  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.80.0
