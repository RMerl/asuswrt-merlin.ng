.TH CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS \- maximum number of redirects allowed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, long amount);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. The set number is the redirection limit \fIamount\fP. If that
many redirections have been followed, the next redirect triggers the error
(\fICURLE_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\fP). This option only makes sense if the
\fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP is used at the same time.

Setting the limit to 0 makes libcurl refuse any redirect.

Set it to -1 for an infinite number of redirects. This allows your application
to get stuck in never-ending redirect loops.
.SH DEFAULT
30 (since 8.3.0), it was previously unlimited.
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP(S)
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");

  /* enable redirect following */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L);

  /* allow three redirects */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 3L);

  /* Perform the request */
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Along with HTTP
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if HTTP is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT (3),
