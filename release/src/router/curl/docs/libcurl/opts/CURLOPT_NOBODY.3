.TH CURLOPT_NOBODY 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NOBODY \- do the download request without getting the body
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NOBODY, long opt);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A long parameter set to 1 tells libcurl to not include the body-part in the
output when doing what would otherwise be a download. For HTTP(S), this makes
libcurl do a HEAD request. For most other protocols it means just not asking
to transfer the body data.

For HTTP operations when \fICURLOPT_NOBODY(3)\fP has been set, disabling this
option (with 0) makes it a GET again - only if the method is still set to be
HEAD. The proper way to get back to a GET request is to set
\fICURLOPT_HTTPGET(3)\fP and for other methods, use the POST or UPLOAD
options.

Enabling \fICURLOPT_NOBODY(3)\fP means asking for a download without a body.

If you do a transfer with HTTP that involves a method other than HEAD, you get
a body (unless the resource and server sends a zero byte body for the specific
URL you request).
.SH DEFAULT
0, the body is transferred
.SH PROTOCOLS
Most

  /* Perform the request */
