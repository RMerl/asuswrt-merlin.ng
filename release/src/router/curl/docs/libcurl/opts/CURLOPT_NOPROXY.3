.TH CURLOPT_NOPROXY 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NOPROXY \- disable proxy use for specific hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NOPROXY, char *noproxy);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a null-terminated string. The string consists of a comma
separated list of host names that do not require a proxy to get reached, even
if one is specified.  The only wildcard available is a single * character,
which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this
list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the
hostname itself. For example, "ample.com" would match ample.com, ample.com:80,
and www.ample.com, but not www.example.com or ample.com.org.

Setting the \fInoproxy\fP string to "" (an empty string) explicitly enables
the proxy for all host names, even if there is an environment variable set for
it.

Enter IPv6 numerical addresses in the list of host names without enclosing
brackets:

 "example.com,::1,localhost"

Since 7.86.0, IP addresses specified to this option can be provided using CIDR
notation: an appended slash and number specifies the number of "network bits"
out of the address to use in the comparison. For example "192.168.0.0/16"
would match all addresses starting with "192.168".

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH "Environment variables"
If there is an environment variable called \fBno_proxy\fP (or \fBNO_PROXY\fP),
it is used if the \fICURLOPT_NOPROXY(3)\fP option is not set. It works exactly
the same way.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL

CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  /* accept various URLs */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, input);
  /* use this proxy */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY, "http://proxy:80");
  /* ... but make sure this host name is not proxied */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_NOPROXY, "www.example.com");
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
