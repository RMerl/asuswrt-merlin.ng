.TH CURLOPT_PROXY_KEYPASSWD 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PROXY_KEYPASSWD \- passphrase for the proxy private key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXY_KEYPASSWD, char *pwd);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This option is for connecting to an HTTPS proxy, not an HTTPS server.

Pass a pointer to a null-terminated string as parameter. It is used as the
password required to use the \fICURLOPT_PROXY_SSLKEY(3)\fP private key.  You
never need a pass phrase to load a certificate but you need one to load your
private key.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

NULL
