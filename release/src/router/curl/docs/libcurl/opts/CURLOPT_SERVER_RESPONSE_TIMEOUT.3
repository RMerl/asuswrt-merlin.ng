.TH CURLOPT_SERVER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT 3 "September 27, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SERVER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT \- time allowed to wait for server response
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SERVER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT,
                          long timeout);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long.  Causes libcurl to set a \fItimeout\fP period (in seconds) on the
amount of time that the server is allowed to take in order to send a response
message for a command before the session is considered dead.  While libcurl is
waiting for a response, this value overrides \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT(3)\fP. It is
recommended that if used in conjunction with \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT(3)\fP, you set
\fICURLOPT_SERVER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT(3)\fP to a value smaller than
\fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT(3)\fP.

This option was formerly known as CURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT.
.SH DEFAULT
None
.SH PROTOCOLS
FTP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and SSH
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/slow.txt");
  /* wait no more than 23 seconds */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SERVER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT, 23L);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);

  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.10.8. Used under this name since 7.20.0

Support for SSH is predicated on a new enough (1.11.0) version of libssh2
being available when compiling libcurl.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not. Returns
CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT if set to a negative value or a value that when
converted to milliseconds is too large.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT (3),
.BR CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT (3),
.BR CURLOPT_TIMEOUT (3)
