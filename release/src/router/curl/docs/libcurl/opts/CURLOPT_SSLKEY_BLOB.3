.TH CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB 3 "May 17, 2022" "libcurl 7.84.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB \- private key for client cert from memory blob
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB,
                          struct curl_blob *blob);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a curl_blob structure, which contains information (pointer
and size) for a private key. Compatible with OpenSSL. The format (like "PEM")
must be specified with \fICURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE(3)\fP.

If the blob is initialized with the flags member of struct curl_blob set to
CURL_BLOB_COPY, the application does not have to keep the buffer around after
setting this.

This option is an alternative to \fICURLOPT_SSLKEY(3)\fP which instead expects
a file name as input.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  struct curl_blob blob;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  blob.data = certificateData;
  blob.len = filesize;
  blob.flags = CURL_BLOB_COPY;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLCERT_BLOB, &blob);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE, "PEM");

  blob.data = privateKeyData;
  blob.len = privateKeySize;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB, &blob);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD, "s3cret");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE, "PEM");
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.71.0. This option is supported by the OpenSSL backends.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if TLS enabled, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE "(3), " CURLOPT_SSLKEY "(3), "
