.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long as parameter set to 1L to enable or 0 to disable.

TCP Fast Open (RFC 7413) is a mechanism that allows data to be carried in the
SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial
connection handshake, saving up to one full round-trip time (RTT).

Beware: the TLS session cache does not work when TCP Fast Open is enabled. TCP
Fast Open is also known to be problematic on or across certain networks.
