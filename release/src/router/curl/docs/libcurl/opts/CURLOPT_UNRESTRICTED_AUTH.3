.TH CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH \- send credentials to other hosts too
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH,
                          long goahead);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the long \fIgohead\fP parameter to 1L to make libcurl continue to send
authentication (user+password) credentials when following locations, even when
hostname changed. This option is meaningful only when setting
\fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP.

Further, when this option is not used or set to \fB0L\fP, libcurl does not
send custom nor internally generated Authentication: headers on requests done
to other hosts than the one used for the initial URL.

By default, libcurl only sends credentials and Authentication headers to the
initial host name as given in the original URL, to avoid leaking username +
password to other sites.

This option should be used with caution: when curl follows redirects it
blindly fetches the next URL as instructed by the server. Setting
\fICURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH(3)\fP to 1L therefore also makes curl trust the
server and sends possibly sensitive credentials to any host the server points
out. And then maybe again and again as the following hosts can keep
redirecting to new hosts.
.SH DEFAULT
0
