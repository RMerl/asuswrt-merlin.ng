.TH CURLOPT_URL 3 "September 26, 2023" "ibcurl 8.4.0" libcurl

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_URL \- URL for this transfer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_URL, char *URL);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass in a pointer to the \fIURL\fP to work with. The parameter should be a
char * to a null-terminated string which must be URL-encoded in the following
format:

scheme://host:port/path

For a greater explanation of the format please see RFC 3986.

libcurl does not validate the syntax or use the URL until the transfer is
started. Even if you set a crazy value here, \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP might
still return \fICURLE_OK\fP.

If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as "http://" or "ftp://" etc)
then libcurl guesses based on the host. If the outermost subdomain name
matches DICT, FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that protocol gets used,
otherwise HTTP is used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
default protocol, see \fICURLOPT_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL(3)\fP for details.

Should the protocol, either as specified by the URL scheme or deduced by
libcurl from the host name, not be supported by libcurl then
\fICURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL\fP is returned from either the
\fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP or \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP functions when you
call them. Use \fIcurl_version_info(3)\fP for detailed information of which
protocols are supported by the build of libcurl you are using.

\fICURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR(3)\fP can be used to limit what protocols libcurl may
use for this transfer, independent of what libcurl has been compiled to
support. That may be useful if you accept the URL from an external source and
want to limit the accessibility.

The \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP string is ignored if \fICURLOPT_CURLU(3)\fP is set.

Either \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP or \fICURLOPT_CURLU(3)\fP must be set before a
transfer is started.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

The parser used for handling the URL set with \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP is the same
that \fIcurl_url_set(3)\fP uses.
.SH ENCODING
The string pointed to in the \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP argument is generally
expected to be a sequence of characters using an ASCII compatible encoding.

If libcurl is built with IDN support, the server name part of the URL can use
an "international name" by using the current encoding (according to locale) or
UTF-8 (when winidn is used; or a Windows Unicode build using libidn2).

If libcurl is built without IDN support, the server name is used exactly as
specified when passed to the name resolver functions.
.SH DEFAULT
There is no default URL. If this option is not set, no transfer can be
performed.
.SH SECURITY CONCERNS
Applications may at times find it convenient to allow users to specify URLs
for various purposes and that string would then end up fed to this option.

Getting a URL from an external untrusted party brings several security
concerns:

If you have an application that runs as or in a server application, getting an
unfiltered URL can easily trick your application to access a local resource
instead of a remote. Protecting yourself against localhost accesses is hard
when accepting user provided URLs.

Such custom URLs can also access other ports than you planned as port numbers
are part of the regular URL format. The combination of a local host and a
custom port number can allow external users to play tricks with your local
services.

Accepting external URLs may also use other protocols than http:// or other
common ones. Restrict what accept with \fICURLOPT_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP.

User provided URLs can also be made to point to sites that redirect further on
(possibly to other protocols too). Consider your
\fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP and \fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP settings.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
POP3 and SMTP were added in 7.31.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK on success or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient
heap space.

Note that \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP does not parse the given string so given a
bad URL, it is not detected until \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP or similar is
called.
