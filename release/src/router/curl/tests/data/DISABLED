# Tests that are disabled here for Hyper are SUPPOSED to work but
# still need adjustments in tests or code. Tests that cannot be
# fixed for hyper should be adjusted for it in the test file.

# hyper support remains EXPERIMENTAL as long as there's a test number
# listed below
#
# Several tests fail due to hyper's lack of trailers support: 266, 1417, 1540,
# 1591, 1943. See https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2699 for details.
