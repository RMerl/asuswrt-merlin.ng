# This file has six functions:
# 1) to completely disable starting this dnsmasq instance
# 2) to set DOMAIN_SUFFIX by running `dnsdomainname`
# 3) to select an alternative config file
#    by setting DNSMASQ_OPTS to --conf-file=<file>
# 4) to tell dnsmasq to read the files in /etc/dnsmasq.d for
#    more configuration variables.
# 5) to stop the resolvconf package from controlling dnsmasq's
#    idea of which upstream nameservers to use.
# 6) to avoid using this dnsmasq instance as the system's default resolver
#    by setting DNSMASQ_EXCEPT="lo"
# For upgraders from very old versions, all the shell variables set
# here in previous versions are still honored by the init script
# so if you just keep your old version of this file nothing will break.

# The dnsmasq daemon is run by default conforming to the Debian Policy.
# To disable the service,
# for SYSV init, use "update-rc.d dnsmasq disable",
# for systemd, use "systemctl disable dnsmasq".

# By default search this drop directory for configuration options.
# Libvirt leaves a file here to make the system dnsmasq play nice.
# Comment out this line if you don't want this. The dpkg-* are file
# endings which cause dnsmasq to skip that file. This avoids pulling
# in backups made by dpkg.

# If the resolvconf package is installed, dnsmasq will use its output
# rather than the contents of /etc/resolv.conf to find upstream
# nameservers. Uncommenting this line inhibits this behaviour.
# Note that including a "resolv-file=<filename>" line in
# /etc/dnsmasq.conf is not enough to override resolvconf if it is
# installed: the line below must be uncommented.
#IGNORE_RESOLVCONF=yes

# If the resolvconf package is installed, dnsmasq will tell resolvconf
# to use dnsmasq under 127.0.0.1 as the system's default resolver.
# Uncommenting this line inhibits this behaviour.
