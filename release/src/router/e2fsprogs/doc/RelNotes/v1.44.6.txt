E2fsprogs 1.44.6 (March 5, 2019)
================================

Updates/Fixes since v1.44.5:

Fixes
-----

If files are created while e4defrag is running, it's quite possible for
succeed_cnt to be larger than total_count, in which case the number of
failures (calculated via total_count - succeed_cnt) will overflow and
become a very large unsigned number.  (Addresses Debian Bug: #888899)

Fix e2fsck so it can correctly handle directories > 2 GiB when the
largedir feature is enabled.

Fix mke2fs's hugefile creation so that we correctly reserve enough
metadata blocks for a given file system size.  Otherwise for certain
unfortunately sized disks/partitions, the hugefile creation would fail.
(Addresses Google Bug: 123239032)

Fix the libext2fs library to be more robust against invalid block group
descriptors to prevent e2fsprogs from crashing (or possibly being
p0wned) by maliciously modified file systems.  (Addresses Google Bugs:
119171089, 119929050)

Fix mke2fs and debugfs so they can correctly copy in files > 2 GiB.

Fix debugfs so its stat command can correct supportly display directory
sizes > 2 GiB.

Fix memory leaks in debugfs, mke2fs, and e2freefrag.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronized changes from Android's AOSP e2fsprogs tree.

Avoid unnecessarily linking badblocks with the libblkid shared library.
(Addresses Debian Bug: #919958)

Stop depending on the debugfs binary for test data, since depending on
the compiler, there might be sufficient aligned zero bytes that the
resulting file(s) created by test cases could have unexpected sparse
blocks, leading to test failures.   (Addresses Google Bug: #122085761)

Fixed various debian packaging issues.
