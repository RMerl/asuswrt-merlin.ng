# Easy-RSA 3 parameter settings

# NOTE: If you installed Easy-RSA from your package manager, do not edit
# this file in place -- instead, you should copy the entire easy-rsa directory
# to another location so future upgrades do not wipe out your changes.

# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
#
# vars.example contains built-in examples to Easy-RSA settings. You MUST name
# this file "vars" if you want it to be used as a configuration file. If you
# do not, it WILL NOT be automatically read when you call easyrsa commands.
#
# It is not necessary to use this config file unless you wish to change
# operational defaults. These defaults should be fine for many uses without
# the need to copy and edit the "vars" file.
#
# All of the editable settings are shown commented and start with the command
# "set_var" -- this means any set_var command that is uncommented has been
# modified by the user. If you are happy with a default, there is no need to
# define the value to its default.

# NOTES FOR WINDOWS USERS
#
# Paths for Windows  *MUST* use forward slashes, or optionally double-escaped
# backslashes (single forward slashes are recommended.) This means your path
# to the openssl binary might look like this:
# "C:/Program Files/OpenSSL-Win32/bin/openssl.exe"

# A little housekeeping: DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION
#
# Easy-RSA 3.x does not source into the environment directly.
# Complain if a user tries to do this:
if [ -z "$EASYRSA_CALLER" ]; then
	echo "You appear to be sourcing an Easy-RSA *vars* file. This is" >&2
	echo "no longer necessary and is disallowed. See the section called" >&2
	echo "*How to use this file* near the top comments for more details." >&2
	return 1

# DO YOUR EDITS BELOW THIS POINT

# This variable is used as the base location of configuration files needed by
# easyrsa.  More specific variables for specific files (eg: EASYRSA_SSL_CONF)
# may override this default.
#
# The default value of this variable is the location of the easyrsa script
# itself, which is also where the configuration files are located in the
# easy-rsa tree.
#
#set_var EASYRSA	"${0%/*}"

# If your OpenSSL command is not in the system PATH, you will need to define
# the path here. Normally this means a full path to the executable, otherwise
# you could have left it undefined here and the shown default would be used.
#
# Windows users, remember to use paths with forward-slashes (or escaped
# back-slashes.) Windows users should declare the full path to the openssl
# binary here if it is not in their system PATH.

# Define X509 DN mode.
#
# This is used to adjust which elements are included in the Subject field
# as the DN ("Distinguished Name"). Note that in 'cn_only' mode the
# Organizational fields, listed further below, are not used.
#
# Choices are:
#   cn_only  - Use just a commonName value.
#   org      - Use the "traditional" format:
#              Country/Province/City/Org/Org.Unit/email/commonName
#
#set_var EASYRSA_DN	"cn_only"

# Organizational fields (used with "org" mode and ignored in "cn_only" mode).
# These are the default values for fields which will be placed in the
# certificate.  Do not leave any of these fields blank, although interactively
# you may omit any specific field by typing the "." symbol (not valid for
# email).

# Set no password mode - This will create the entire PKI without passwords.
# This can be better managed by choosing which entity private keys should be

# Choose a size in bits for your keypairs. The recommended value is 2048.
# Using 2048-bit keys is considered more than sufficient for many years into

# param generation take much longer. Values up to 4096 should be accepted by
# most software. Only used when the crypto alg is rsa, see below.
#
#set_var EASYRSA_KEY_SIZE	2048

# The default crypto mode is rsa; ec can enable elliptic curve support.

# Support deprecated "Netscape" extensions? (choices "yes" or "no").
# The default is "no", to discourage use of deprecated extensions.
# If you require this feature to use with --ns-cert-type, set this to "yes".
# This support should be replaced with the more modern --remote-cert-tls
# feature.  If you do not use --ns-cert-type in your configs, it is safe,
# and recommended, to leave this defined to "no".
# When set to "yes", server-signed certs get the nsCertType=server attribute
# and also get any NS_COMMENT defined below in the nsComment field.
#
#set_var EASYRSA_NS_SUPPORT	"no"

# Broken shell command aliases: If you have a largely broken shell that is
# missing any of these POSIX-required commands used by Easy-RSA, you will need
# to define an alias to the proper path for the command.  The symptom will be
# some form of a "command not found" error from your shell. This means your
# shell is BROKEN, but you can hack around it here if you really need. These
# shown values are not defaults: it is up to you to know what you are doing if
# you touch these.

# X509 extensions directory:
# If you want to customize the X509 extensions used, set the directory to look
# for extensions here. Each cert type you sign must have a matching filename,
# and an optional file named "COMMON" is included first when present. Note that
# when undefined here, default behaviour is to look in $EASYRSA_PKI first, then
# fallback to $EASYRSA for the "x509-types" dir.  You may override this
# detection with an explicit dir here.

# OpenSSL config file:
# If you need to use a specific openssl config file, you can reference it here.
# Normally this file is auto-detected from a file named openssl-easyrsa.cnf
# from the EASYRSA_PKI or EASYRSA dir, in that order. NOTE that this file is
# Easy-RSA specific and you cannot just use a standard config file, so this is
# an advanced feature.
