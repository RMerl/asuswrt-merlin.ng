               RADIUS Authentication Client MIB for IPv6

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS
   authentication client functions.  These extensions represent a
   portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  Using these
   extensions, IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS
   authentication clients.

   This memo obsoletes RFC 2618 by deprecating the MIB table containing
   IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for
   version-neutral IP address formats.  The remaining MIB objects from
   RFC 2618 are carried forward into this document.  The memo also adds
   UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.

RFC 4668             RADIUS Auth Client MIB (IPv6)           August 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   The objects defined within this memo relate to the Remote
   Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Authentication Client as
   defined in RFC 2865 [RFC2865].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865].

   This document uses the word "malformed" with respect to RADIUS
   packets, particularly in the context of counters of "malformed
   packets".  While RFC 2865 does not provide an explicit definition of
   "malformed", malformed generally means that the implementation has
   determined the packet does not match the format defined in RFC 2865.
   Some implementations may determine that packets are malformed when
   the Vendor Specific Attribute (VSA) format does not follow the RFC
   2865 recommendations for VSAs.  Those implementations are used in
   deployments today, and thus set the de facto definition of
   "malformed".

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Scope of Changes

   This document obsoletes RFC 2618 [RFC2618], RADIUS Authentication
   Client MIB, by deprecating the radiusAuthServerTable table and adding
   a new table, radiusAuthServerExtTable, containing
   radiusAuthServerInetAddressType, radiusAuthServerInetAddress, and

RFC 4668             RADIUS Auth Client MIB (IPv6)           August 2006


   radiusAuthClientServerInetPortNumber.  The purpose of these added MIB
   objects is to support version-neutral IP addressing formats.  The
   existing table containing radiusAuthServerAddress and
   radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber is deprecated.  The remaining MIB
   objects are carried forward from RFC 2618 into this document.  This
   memo also adds UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.

   RFC 4001 [RFC4001], which defines the SMI Textual Conventions for
   IPv6 addresses, contains the following recommendation.

   'In particular, when revising a MIB module that contains IPv4
   specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables using the
   textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC4001] that support all
   versions of IP.  The status of the new tables SHOULD be "current",
   whereas the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be
   changed to "deprecated".  The other approach, of having multiple
   similar tables for different IP versions, is strongly discouraged.'

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The RADIUS authentication protocol, described in RFC 2865 [RFC2865],
   distinguishes between the client function and the server function.
   In RADIUS authentication, clients send Access-Requests, and servers
   reply with Access-Accepts, Access-Rejects, and Access-Challenges.
   Typically, Network Access Server (NAS) devices implement the client
   function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS
   authentication client MIB, while RADIUS authentication servers
   implement the server function, and thus would be expected to
   implement the RADIUS authentication server MIB.

   However, it is possible for a RADIUS authentication entity to perform
   both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS proxy may
   act as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while
   simultaneously acting as an authentication client to one or more
   authentication servers.  In such situations, it is expected that
   RADIUS entities combining client and server functionality will
   support both the client and server MIBs.  The client MIB is defined
   in this document, and the server MIB is defined in [RFC4669].

   This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table, the
   RADIUS Authentication Server Table, which contains one row for each
   RADIUS authentication server with which the client shares a secret.
   Each entry in the RADIUS Authentication Server Table includes sixteen
   columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS
   authentication client.

   This MIB imports from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], and [RFC4001].

6.  Deprecated Objects

   The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward from RFC 2618
   [RFC2618].  There are two conditions under which it MAY be desirable
   for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table:

   1.  The managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.

   2.  The managed entity supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats,
       and the deprecated table is supported for backwards compatibility
       with older management stations.  This option SHOULD only be used
       when the IP addresses in the new table are in IPv4 format and can
       accurately be represented in both the new table and the
       deprecated table.

   Managed entities SHOULD NOT instantiate row entries in the deprecated
   table, containing IPv4-only address objects, when the RADIUS server
   address represented in such a table row is not an IPv4 address.
   Managed entities SHOULD NOT return inaccurate values of IP address or
   SNMP object access errors for IPv4-only address objects in otherwise
   populated tables.  When row entries exist in both the deprecated
   IPv4-only table and the new IP-version-neutral table that describe
   the same RADIUS server, the row indexes SHOULD be the same for the
   corresponding rows in each table, to facilitate correlation of these
   related rows by management applications.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   radiusAuthServerIPAddress
      This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS
      authentication server with which the client is communicating.
      This information could be useful in mounting an attack on the
      authentication server.

   radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber
      This can be used to determine the port number on which the RADIUS
      authentication client is sending.  This information could be
      useful in impersonating the client in order to send data to the
      authentication server.

   radiusAuthServerInetAddress
      This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS
      authentication server with which the client is communicating.
      This information could be useful in mounting an attack on the
      authentication server.

   radiusAuthClientServerInetPortNumber
      This can be used to determine the port number on which the RADIUS
      authentication client is sending.  This information could be
      useful in impersonating the client in order to send data to the
      authentication server.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
