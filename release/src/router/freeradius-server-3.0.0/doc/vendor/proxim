Proxim
^^^^^^

Proxim AP-2000 NASes up to and including firmware version 2.4.5 ignore
the Session-Timeout attribute, despite the fact that Proxim's firmware
release notes specifically state that it is supported.  On top of
this, firmware version 2.4.5 (the latest as of this writing) has a bug
in which the reauthentication interval on the AP cannot be set to any
value less than 2 hours.  As such, fine-grained control of client
session times is not currently possible with this NAS.  Note that this
NAS is OEMed to several vendors, including Avaya, and may be listed
under different names with different vendors.
