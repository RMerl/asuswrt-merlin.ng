This directory contains the ASN.1 specification of the SNMP OIDs
assigned to RADIUS MIB work by the IANA. The specifications in
RADIUS-ACC-SERVER-MIB.txt and RADIUS-AUTH-SERVER-MIB.txt are
extracted from RFCs 2621 and 2619 accordingly. The corresponding
RFCs can be found in subdirectory doc/rfc of the package. Both
RFCs allow unlimited distribution of the information contained
therein.

*.chart files contain the graphic representation of the corresponding
MIB trees.
