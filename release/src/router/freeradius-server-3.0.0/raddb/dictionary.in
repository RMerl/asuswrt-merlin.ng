#
#	This is the master dictionary file, which references the
#	pre-defined dictionary files included with the server.
#
#	Any new/changed attributes MUST be placed in this file, as
#	the pre-defined dictionaries SHOULD NOT be edited.
#
#	See "man dictionary" for documentation on its format.
#
#	$Id$
#

#
#	The filename given here should be an absolute path.
#
$INCLUDE	@prefix@/share/freeradius/dictionary

#
#	All additional attributes an $INCLUDE's should go into
#	a file "dictionary.local".

#	If you want to add entries to the dictionary file,
#	which are NOT going to be placed in a RADIUS packet,
#	add them to the 'dictionary.local' file.
#
#	The numbers you pick should be between 3000 and 4000.
#	These attributes will NOT go into a RADIUS packet.
#
#	If you want that, you will need to use VSAs.  This means
#	requesting allocation of a Private Enterprise Code from
#	http://iana.org.  We STRONGLY suggest doing that only if
#	you are a vendor of RADIUS equipment.
#
#	See RFC 6158 for more details.
#	http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc6158.txt
#

#
#	These attributes are examples.  Don't edit them here.
#	Instead, create a "dictionary.local" file, and place
#	them there.
#
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-String		3000	string
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-IPAddr		3001	ipaddr
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-Integer	3002	integer

#
#	Include dictionary.local, IF it exists.  Otherwise, ignore it.
#
#	This file WILL NOT EVER be created, edited, or modified
#	by FreeRADIUS.
