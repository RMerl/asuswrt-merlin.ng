	# Configuration for the Python module.

	# Where radiusd is a Python module, radiusd.py, and the
	# function 'authorize' is called.  Here is a dummy piece
	# of code:
	#
	#	def authorize(params):
	#		print params
	#		return (5, ('Reply-Message', 'banned'))
	#
	# The RADIUS value-pairs are passed as a tuple of tuple
	# pairs as the first argument, e.g. (('attribute1',
	# 'value1'), ('attribute2', 'value2'))
	#
	# The function return is a tuple with the first element
	# being the return value of the function.
	# The 5 corresponds to RLM_MODULE_USERLOCK. I plan to
	# write the return values as Python symbols to avoid
	# confusion.
	#
	# The remaining tuple members are the string form of
	# value-pairs which are passed on to pairmake().
	#
