#  counter module:
#  This module takes an attribute (count-attribute).
#  It also takes a key, and creates a counter for each unique
#  key.  The count is incremented when accounting packets are
#  received by the server.  The value of the increment depends
#  on the attribute type.
#  If the attribute is Acct-Session-Time or of an integer type we add
#  the value of the attribute. If it is anything else we increase the
#  counter by one.
#
#  The 'reset' parameter defines when the counters are all reset to
#  zero.  It can be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or never.
#
#  hourly: Reset on 00:00 of every hour
#  daily: Reset on 00:00:00 every day
#  weekly: Reset on 00:00:00 on sunday
#  monthly: Reset on 00:00:00 of the first day of each month
#
#  It can also be user defined. It should be of the form:
#  num[hdwm] where:
#  h: hours, d: days, w: weeks, m: months
#  If the letter is omitted days will be assumed. In example:
#  reset = 10h (reset every 10 hours)
#  reset = 12  (reset every 12 days)
#
#
#  The check_name attribute defines an attribute which will be
#  registered by the counter module and can be used to set the
#  maximum allowed value for the counter after which the user
#  is rejected.
#  Something like:
#
#  DEFAULT Max-Daily-Session := 36000
#          Fall-Through = 1
#
#  You should add the counter module in the instantiate
#  section so that it registers check_name before the files
#  module reads the users file.
#
#  If check_name is set and the user is to be rejected then we
#  send back a Reply-Message and we log a Failure-Message in
#  the radius.log
#
#  If the count attribute is Acct-Session-Time then on each
#  login we send back the remaining online time as a
#  Session-Timeout attribute ELSE and if the reply_name is
#  set, we send back that attribute.  The reply_name attribute
#  MUST be of an integer type.
#
#  The counter-name can also be used instead of using the check_name
#  like below:
#
#  DEFAULT  Daily-Session-Time > 3600, Auth-Type = Reject
#      Reply-Message = "You've used up more than one hour today"
#
#  The allowed_service_type attribute can be used to only take
#  into account specific sessions. For example if a user first
#  logs in through a login menu and then selects ppp there will
#  be two sessions. One for Login-User and one for Framed-User
#  service type. We only need to take into account the second one.
#
#  The module should be added in the instantiate, authorize and
#  accounting sections.  Make sure that in the authorize
#  section it comes after any module which sets the
#  'check_name' attribute.
