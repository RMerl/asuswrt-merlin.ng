#  Whatever you do, do NOT set 'Auth-Type := EAP'.  The server
#  is smart enough to figure this out on its own.  The most
#  common side effect of setting 'Auth-Type := EAP' is that the
#  users then cannot use ANY other authentication method.
#
#  EAP types NOT listed here may be supported via the "eap2" module.
#  See experimental.conf for documentation.

	#
	#  The incoming EAP messages DO NOT specify which EAP
	#  type they will be using, so it MUST be set here.
	#
	#  For now, only one default EAP type may be used at a time.
	#
	#  If the EAP-Type attribute is set by another module,
	#  then that EAP type takes precedence over the

	#  There are many EAP types, but the server has support
	#  for only a limited subset.  If the server receives
	#  a request for an EAP type it does not support, then
	#  it normally rejects the request.  By setting this
	#  configuration to "yes", you can tell the server to
	#  instead keep processing the request.  Another module
	#  MUST then be configured to proxy the request to
	#  another RADIUS server which supports that EAP type.

	#  As a result, LEAP *requires* access to the plain-text

		#  The plain-text response which comes back
		#  is put into a User-Password attribute,
		#  and passed to another module for
		#  authentication.  This allows the EAP-GTC
		#  response to be checked against plain-text,
		#  or crypt'd passwords.
		#
		#  If you say "Local" instead of "PAP", then
		#  the module will look for a User-Password
		#  configured for the request, and do the
		#  authentication itself.

	#  If these certificates have not been auto-generated:
	#    cd raddb/certs

	#  These test certificates SHOULD NOT be used in a normal
	#  deployment.  They are created only to make it easier
	#  to install the server, and to perform some simple

	#  e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
