#  "passwd" configuration, for the /etc/group file. Adds a Etc-Group-Name
#  attribute for every group that the user is member of.
#
#  You will have to define the Etc-Group-Name in the 'dictionary' file
#  as a 'string' type.
#
#  The Group and Group-Name attributes are automatically created by
#  the Unix module, and do checking against /etc/group automatically.
#  This means that you CANNOT use Group or Group-Name to do any other
#  kind of grouping in the server.  You MUST define a new group
#  attribute.
#
#  i.e. this module should NOT be used as-is, but should be edited to
#  point to a different group file.
