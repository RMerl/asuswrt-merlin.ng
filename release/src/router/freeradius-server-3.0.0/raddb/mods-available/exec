#  Execute external programs
#
#  This module is useful only for 'xlat'.  To use it,
#  put 'exec' into the 'instantiate' section.  You can then
#  do dynamic translation of attributes like:
#
#  Attribute-Name = `%{exec:/path/to/program args}`
#
#  The value of the attribute will be replaced with the output
#  of the program which is executed.  Due to RADIUS protocol
#  limitations, any output over 253 bytes will be ignored.
#
#  The RADIUS attributes from the user request will be placed
#  into environment variables of the executed program, as
#  described in "man unlang" and in doc/variables.txt
#
#  See also "echo" for more sample configuration.

exec {
	wait = no
	input_pairs = request
	shell_escape = yes
	output = none
}
