# Internationalised domain names.

#  The expansion string: %{idn: example.com} results in an ASCII
#  punycode version of the domain name.  That version can then be used
#  for name comparisons.  Using an i18n version of the name is NOT
#  RECOMMENDED, as that version is not canonical.
#
#  i.e. the "same" domain name can be represented in many, many,
#  different ways.  Only the idn version has *one* representation.
