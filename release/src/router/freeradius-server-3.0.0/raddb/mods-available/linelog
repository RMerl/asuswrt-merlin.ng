#  The "linelog" module will log one line of text to a file.

	#  The Unix-style permissions on the log file.

	#  Depending on format string, the log file may contain secret or
	#  private information about users.  Keep the file permissions as
	#  restrictive as possible.

	# The user that freeradius runs as must be in the specified
	# group, otherwise it will not be possible to set the group.

	format = "This is a log message for %{User-Name}"

	#
	#  This next line can be omitted.  If it is omitted, then
	#  the log message is static, and is always given by "format",
	#  above.
	#
	#  If it is defined, then the string is dynamically expanded,
	#  and the result is used to find another configuration entry
	#  here, with the given name.  That name is then used as the
	#  format string.
	#
	#  If the configuration entry cannot be found, then no log
	#  message is printed.
	#
	#  i.e. You can have many log messages in one "linelog" module.
	#  If this two-step expansion did not exist, you would have
	#  needed to configure one "linelog" module for each log message.

	#
	#  Reference the Packet-Type (Access-Request, etc.)  If it doesn't
	#  exist, reference the "format" entry, above.

	#
	#  The log messages can be grouped into sections and
        #  sub-sections, too.  The "reference" item needs to have a "."
	#  for every section.  e.g. reference = foo.bar will reference
	#  the "foo" section, "bar" configuration item.
	#

	#
	#  Used if:	reference = "foo.bar".
	foo {
	    bar = "Example log.  Please ignore"

	#      reference = "Accounting-Request.%{%{Acct-Status-Type}:-unknown}"
	#

		Stop = "Disconnect: [%{User-Name}] (did %{Called-Station-Id} cli %{Calling-Station-Id} port %{NAS-Port} ip %{Framed-IP-Address}) %{Acct-Session-Time} seconds"
