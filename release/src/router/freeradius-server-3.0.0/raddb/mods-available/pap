# PAP module to authenticate users based on their stored password
#
#  Supports multiple encryption/hash schemes.  See "man rlm_pap"
#  for details.
#
#  For instructions on creating the various types of passwords, see:
#
#  http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html
pap {
	#  The "auto_header" configuration item can be set to "yes".
	#  In this case, the module will look inside of the User-Password
	#  attribute for the headers {crypt}, {clear}, etc., and will
	#  automatically create the attribute on the right-hand side,
	#  with the correct value.
	auto_header = no

	#  By default the server will use heuristics to try and automatically
	#  handle base64 or hex encoded passwords. This behaviour can be
	#  stopped by setting the following to "no".
#	normalise = yes
