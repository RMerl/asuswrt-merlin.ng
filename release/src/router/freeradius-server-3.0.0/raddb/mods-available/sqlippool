	#  we have to list it here as we do not yet support nested
	#  reference expansions.

	# Attribute which should be considered unique per NAS
	#
	#  Using NAS-Port gives behaviour similar to rlm_ippool. (And ACS)

	#  ONLY change this if you know what you are doing!

	#           We suggest using an SQL DB with proper transaction
