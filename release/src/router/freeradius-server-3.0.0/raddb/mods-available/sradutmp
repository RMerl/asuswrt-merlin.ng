# "Safe" radutmp - does not contain caller ID, so it can be
# world-readable, and radwho can work for normal users, without
# exposing any information that isn't already exposed by who(1).
#
# This is another 'instance' of the radutmp module, but it is given
# then name "sradutmp" to identify it later in the "accounting"
# section.
