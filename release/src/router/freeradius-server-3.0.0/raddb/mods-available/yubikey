#
#  This module decrypts and validates Yubikey static and dynamic
#  OTP tokens.
#
yubikey {
	#
	#  The length (number of ASCII bytes) of the Public-ID portion
	#  of the OTP string.
	#
	#  Yubikey defaults to a 6 byte ID (2 * 6 = 12)
#	id_length = 12

	#
	#  Decrypt mode - Tokens will be decrypted and processed locally
	#
	#  The module itself does not provide persistent storage as this
	#  would be duplicative of functionality already in the server.
	#
	#  Yubikey authentication needs two control attributes
	#  retrieved from persistent storage:
	#    * Yubikey-Key     - The AES key used to decrypt the OTP data.
	#                        The Yubikey-Public-Id and/or User-Name
	#                        attributes may be used to retrieve the key.
	#    * Yubikey-Counter - This is compared with the counter in the OTP
	#                        data and used to prevent replay attacks.
	#                        This attribute will also be available in
	#                        the request list after successful
	#                        decryption.
	#
	#  Yubikey-Counter isn't strictly required, but the server will
	#  generate warnings if it's not present when yubikey.authenticate
	#  is called.
	#
	#  These attributes are available after authorization:
	#    * Yubikey-Public-ID  - The public portion of the OTP string
	#
	#  These attributes are available after authentication (if successful):
	#    * Yubikey-Private-ID - The encrypted ID included in OTP data,
	#                           must be verified if tokens share keys.
	#    * Yubikey-Counter    - The last counter value (should be recorded).
	#    * Yubikey-Timestamp  - Token's internal clock (mainly useful for debugging).
	#    * Yubikey-Random     - Randomly generated value from the token.

	#  Validation mode - Tokens will be validated against a Yubicloud server

	validation {
		#
		#  URL of validation server, multiple URL config items may be used

			# unused for this length of time will be closed.
			idle_timeout = 60

			# Cycle over all connections in a pool instead of concentrating
			# connection use on a few connections.
			spread = yes

			# NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
			# connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
			# "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
			# connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
			# happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
			# also log a WARNING message.
			#
			# The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
			# or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.
