#
#	Configuration file for the rlm_attr_filter module.
#	Please see rlm_attr_filter(5) manpage for more information.

#	$Id$
#
#	This file contains security and configuration information
#	for each realm. The first field is the realm name and
#	can be up to 253 characters in length. This is followed (on
#	the next line) with the list of filter rules to be used to
#	decide what attributes and/or values we allow proxy servers
#	to pass to the NAS for this realm.
#
#	When a proxy-reply packet is received from a home server,
#	these attributes and values are tested. Only the first match
#	is used unless the "Fall-Through" variable is set to "Yes".
#	In that case the rules defined in the DEFAULT case are
#	processed as well.
#
#	A special realm named "DEFAULT" matches on all realm names.
#	You can have only one DEFAULT entry. All entries are processed
#	in the order they appear in this file. The first entry that
#	matches the login-request will stop processing unless you use
#	the Fall-Through variable.
#
#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#	line indicate the filter rules.
#
#	You can include another `attrs' file with `$INCLUDE attrs.other'
#

#
# This is a complete entry for realm "fisp". Note that there is no
# Fall-Through entry so that no DEFAULT entry will be used, and the
# server will NOT allow any other a/v pairs other than the ones
# listed here.
#
# These rules allow:
#     o  Only Framed-User Service-Types ( no telnet, rlogin, tcp-clear )
#     o  PPP sessions ( no SLIP, CSLIP, etc. )
#     o  dynamic ip assignment ( can't assign a static ip )
#     o  an idle timeout value set to 600 seconds (10 min) or less
#     o  a max session time set to 28800 seconds (8 hours) or less

# This is a complete entry for realm "tisp". Note that there is no
# Fall-Through entry so that no DEFAULT entry will be used, and the
# server will NOT allow any other a/v pairs other than the ones
# listed here.
#
# These rules allow:
#       o Only Login-User Service-Type ( no framed/ppp sessions )
#       o Telnet sessions only ( no rlogin, tcp-clear )
#       o Login hosts of either 192.0.2.1 or 192.0.2.2

#
# The following example can be used for a home server which is only
# allowed to supply a Reply-Message, a Session-Timeout attribute of
# maximum 86400, a Idle-Timeout attribute of maximum 600 and a
# Acct-Interim-Interval attribute between 300 and 3600.
# All other attributes sent back will be filtered out.

#
# This is a complete entry for realm "spamrealm". Fall-Through is used,
# so that the DEFAULT filter rules are used in addition to these.
#
# These rules allow:
#       o Force the application of Filter-ID attribute to be returned
#         in the proxy reply, whether the proxy sent it or not.
#       o The standard DEFAULT rules as defined below

#
# The rest of this file contains the DEFAULT entry.
# DEFAULT matches with all realm names. (except if the realm previously
# matched an entry with no Fall-Through)
