#	Configuration file for the rlm_attr_filter module.

#
#	This file contains security and configuration information
#	for each realm. It can be used be an rlm_attr_filter module
#	instance to filter attributes before sending packets to the
#	home server of a realm.
#
#	When a packet is sent to a home server, these attributes
#	and values are tested. Only the first match is used unless
#	the "Fall-Through" variable is set to "Yes". In that case
#	the rules defined in the DEFAULT case are processed as well.
#
#	A special realm named "DEFAULT" matches on all realm names.
#	You can have only one DEFAULT entry. All entries are processed
#	in the order they appear in this file. The first entry that
#	matches the login-request will stop processing unless you use
#	the Fall-Through variable.
#
#	The first line indicates the realm to which the rules apply.
#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#	line indicate the filter rules.
#

# This is a complete entry for 'nochap' realm. It allows to send very
# basic attributes to the home server. Note that there is no Fall-Through
# entry so that no DEFAULT entry will be used. Only the listed attributes
# will be sent in the packet, all other attributes will be filtered out.
#
#nochap
#	User-Name =* ANY,
#	User-Password =* ANY,
#	NAS-Ip-Address =* ANY,
#	NAS-Identifier =* ANY

# The entry for the 'brokenas' realm removes the attribute NAS-Port-Type
# if its value is different from 'Ethernet'. Then the default rules are
# applied.
#
#brokenas
#	NAS-Port-Type == Ethernet
#	Fall-Through = Yes

# The rest of this file contains the DEFAULT entry.
# DEFAULT matches with all realm names.
