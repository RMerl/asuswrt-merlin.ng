#  Rather than maintaining separate (GDBM) databases of
#  accounting info for each counter, this module uses the data
#  stored in the raddacct table by the sql modules. This
#  module NEVER does any database INSERTs or UPDATEs.  It is
#  totally dependent on the SQL module to process Accounting
#  packets.
#
#  The 'sql-module-instance' parameter holds the instance of the sql
#  module to use when querying the SQL database. Normally it
#  is just "sql".  If you define more and one SQL module
#  instance (usually for failover situations), you can
#  specify which module has access to the Accounting Data
#  (radacct table).
#
#  The 'reset' parameter defines when the counters are all
#  reset to zero.  It can be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or
#  never.  It can also be user defined. It should be of the
#  form:
#  	num[hdwm] where:
#  	h: hours, d: days, w: weeks, m: months
#  	If the letter is ommited days will be assumed. In example:
#  	reset = 10h (reset every 10 hours)
#  	reset = 12  (reset every 12 days)
#
#  The 'key' parameter specifies the unique identifier for the
#  counter records (usually 'User-Name').
#
#  The 'query' parameter specifies the SQL query used to get
#  the current Counter value from the database. There are 3
#  parameters that can be used in the query:
#		%b	unix time value of beginning of reset period
#		%e	unix time value of end of reset period
#
#  The 'check_name' parameter is the name of the 'check'
#  attribute to use to access the counter in the 'users' file
#  or SQL radcheck or radcheckgroup tables.
