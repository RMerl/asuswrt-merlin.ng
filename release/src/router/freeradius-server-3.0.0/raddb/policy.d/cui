#
#  The following policies are for the Chargeable-User-Identity
#  (CUI) configuration.
#
#  The policies below can be called as just 'cui' (not
#  cui.authorize etc..)  from the various config sections.
#

#
#  cui_hash_key definition
#  This key serves the purpose of protecting CUI values against
#  dictionary attacks, therefore should be chosen as a "random"
#  string and kept secret.
#
cui_hash_key = "changeme"

#
# cui_require_operator_name switch
# If this is set to nonzero value then CUI will only be added
# when a non-empty Operator-Name value is present in the request
#
cui_require_operator_name = "no"

#
#  The client indicates it can do CUI by sending a CUI attribute
#  containing one zero byte.
#  A non-empty value in Operator-Name can be an additional requirement.
#  Normally CUI support is turned on only for such requests.
#  CUI support can be used for local clients which do not
#  supports CUI themselves, the server can simulate a CUI request
#  adding the missing NUL CUI value and the Operator-Name attribute.
#  Clients which are supposed to get this treatment should
#  be marked by add_cui flag in clients.conf
#  We assume that local clients are marked in the client.conf with
#  add_cui flag, e.g.
#  client xxxx {
#    ...
#    add_cui = yes
#  }

#  attribute should be added, unless it is already present in the request.
