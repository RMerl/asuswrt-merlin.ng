#
#  The following policies are for the Operator-Name
#  configuration.
#
#  The policies below can be called as just 'oprator-name' (not
#  oprator-name.authorize etc..)  from the various config sections.
#

#  If you require that the Operator-Name be set
#  for local clients then call the 'operator-name' policy
#  in the authorize section of the virtual-server for your clients in clients.conf

#  to inject an Operator-Name whilst proxying, call the
#  'operator-name' policy in the pre-proxy section of the virtual server
#  No need to call this if you have already enabled this in
#  the authorize section.

#
#  We assume that clients can have the operator-name definition
#  in the client.conf, e.g.
#  client xxxx {
#    ...
#    Operator-Name = 1your.domain
#  }
#  If this parameter is found for a client, then we add
#  an Operator-Name attribute
#
operator-name.authorize {
	if ("%{client:Operator-Name}") {
		update request {
			Operator-Name = "%{client:Operator-Name}"
		}
	}
}

#
# Before proxing the client add an Operator-Name
# attribute identifying this site if the operator-name is found for this client
#
operator-name.pre-proxy {
	if (("%{request:Packet-Type}" == 'Access-Request') && "%{client:Operator-Name}") {
		update proxy-request {
			Operator-Name := "%{client:Operator-Name}"
		}
	}
}
