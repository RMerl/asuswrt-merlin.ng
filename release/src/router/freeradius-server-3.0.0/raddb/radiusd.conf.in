######################################################################
#
#	Read "man radiusd" before editing this file.  See the section
#	titled DEBUGGING.  It outlines a method where you can quickly
#	obtain the configuration you want, without running into
#	trouble.
#
#	Run the server in debugging mode, and READ the output.
#
#		$ radiusd -X
#
#	We cannot emphasize this point strongly enough.  The vast
#	majority of problems can be solved by carefully reading the
#	debugging output, which includes warnings about common issues,
#	and suggestions for how they may be fixed.
#
#	There may be a lot of output, but look carefully for words like:
#	"warning", "error", "reject", or "failure".  The messages there
#	will usually be enough to guide you to a solution.
#
#	If you are going to ask a question on the mailing list, then
#	explain what you are trying to do, and include the output from
#	debugging mode (radiusd -X).  Failure to do so means that all
#	of the responses to your question will be people telling you
#	to "post the output of radiusd -X".

#
# libdir: Where to find the rlm_* modules.
#
#   This should be automatically set at configuration time.
#
#   If the server builds and installs, but fails at execution time
#   with an 'undefined symbol' error, then you can use the libdir
#   directive to work around the problem.
#
#   The cause is usually that a library has been installed on your
#   system in a place where the dynamic linker CANNOT find it.  When
#   executing as root (or another user), your personal environment MAY
#   be set up to allow the dynamic linker to find the library.  When
#   executing as a daemon, FreeRADIUS MAY NOT have the same
#   personalized configuration.
#
#   To work around the problem, find out which library contains that symbol,
#   and add the directory containing that library to the end of 'libdir',
#   with a colon separating the directory names.  NO spaces are allowed.
#
#   e.g. libdir = /usr/local/lib:/opt/package/lib
#
#   You can also try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
#   in a script which starts the server.
#
#   If that does not work, then you can re-configure and re-build the
#   server to NOT use shared libraries, via:
#
#	./configure --disable-shared
#	make
#	make install
#
libdir = @libdir@

#  pidfile: Where to place the PID of the RADIUS server.
#
#  The server may be signalled while it's running by using this
#  file.
#
#  This file is written when ONLY running in daemon mode.
#
#  e.g.:  kill -HUP `cat /var/run/radiusd/radiusd.pid`
#
pidfile = ${run_dir}/${name}.pid

#  max_request_time: The maximum time (in seconds) to handle a request.
#
#  Requests which take more time than this to process may be killed, and
#  a REJECT message is returned.
#
#  WARNING: If you notice that requests take a long time to be handled,
#  then this MAY INDICATE a bug in the server, in one of the modules
#  used to handle a request, OR in your local configuration.
#
#  This problem is most often seen when using an SQL database.  If it takes
#  more than a second or two to receive an answer from the SQL database,
#  then it probably means that you haven't indexed the database.  See your
#  SQL server documentation for more information.
#
#  Useful range of values: 5 to 120
#
max_request_time = 30

#  cleanup_delay: The time to wait (in seconds) before cleaning up
#  a reply which was sent to the NAS.
#
#  The RADIUS request is normally cached internally for a short period
#  of time, after the reply is sent to the NAS.  The reply packet may be
#  lost in the network, and the NAS will not see it.  The NAS will then
#  re-send the request, and the server will respond quickly with the
#  cached reply.
#
#  If this value is set too low, then duplicate requests from the NAS
#  MAY NOT be detected, and will instead be handled as separate requests.
#
#  If this value is set too high, then the server will cache too many
#  requests, and some new requests may get blocked.  (See 'max_requests'.)
#
#  Useful range of values: 2 to 10
#
cleanup_delay = 5

#  max_requests: The maximum number of requests which the server keeps
#  track of.  This should be 256 multiplied by the number of clients.
#  e.g. With 4 clients, this number should be 1024.
#
#  If this number is too low, then when the server becomes busy,
#  it will not respond to any new requests, until the 'cleanup_delay'
#  time has passed, and it has removed the old requests.
#
#  If this number is set too high, then the server will use a bit more
#  memory for no real benefit.
#
#  If you aren't sure what it should be set to, it's better to set it
#  too high than too low.  Setting it to 1000 per client is probably
#  the highest it should be.
#
#  Useful range of values: 256 to infinity
#
max_requests = 1024

#  hostname_lookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
#  e.g., www.freeradius.org (on) or 206.47.27.232 (off).
#
#  The default is 'off' because it would be overall better for the net
#  if people had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it
#  means that each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup
#  request to the nameserver.   Enabling hostname_lookups will also
#  mean that your server may stop randomly for 30 seconds from time
#  to time, if the DNS requests take too long.
#
#  Turning hostname lookups off also means that the server won't block
#  for 30 seconds, if it sees an IP address which has no name associated
#  with it.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
hostname_lookups = no

#
#  Logging section.  The various "log_*" configuration items
#  will eventually be moved here.

	#	syslog - to syslog (see also the "syslog_facility", below.
	#	stdout - standard output
	#	stderr - standard error.
	#
	#  The command-line option "-X" over-rides this option, and forces
	#  logging to go to stdout.
	#
	destination = files

	#
	#  Highlight important messages sent to stderr and stdout.
	#
	#  Option will be ignored (disabled) if output if TERM is not
	#  an xterm or output is not to a TTY.
	#
	colourise = yes

	#
	#  The logging messages for the server are appended to the
	#  tail of this file if destination == "files"
	#
	#  If the server is running in debugging mode, this file is
	#  NOT used.
	#
	file = ${logdir}/radius.log

	#
	#  If this configuration parameter is set, then log messages for
	#  a *request* go to this file, rather than to radius.log.
	#
	#  i.e. This is a log file per request, once the server has accepted
	#  the request as being from a valid client.  Messages that are
	#  not associated with a request still go to radius.log.
	#
	#  Not all log messages in the server core have been updated to use
	#  this new internal API.  As a result, some messages will still
	#  go to radius.log.  Please submit patches to fix this behavior.
	#
	#  The file name is expanded dynamically.  You should ONLY user
	#  server-side attributes for the filename (e.g. things you control).
	#  Using this feature MAY also slow down the server substantially,
	#  especially if you do thinks like SQL calls as part of the
	#  expansion of the filename.
	#
	#  The name of the log file should use attributes that don't change
	#  over the lifetime of a request, such as User-Name,
	#  Virtual-Server or Packet-Src-IP-Address.  Otherwise, the log
	#  messages will be distributed over multiple files.
	#
	#  Logging can be enabled for an individual request by a special
	#  dynamic expansion macro:  %{debug: 1}, where the debug level
	#  for this request is set to '1' (or 2, 3, etc.).  e.g.
	#
	#	...
	#	update control {
	#	       Tmp-String-0 = "%{debug:1}"
	#	}
	#	...
	#
	#  The attribute that the value is assigned to is unimportant,
	#  and should be a "throw-away" attribute with no side effects.

# SECURITY CONFIGURATION
#
#  There may be multiple methods of attacking on the server.  This
#  section holds the configuration items which minimize the impact
#  of those attacks
#
security {
	#  chroot: directory where the server does "chroot".
	#
	#  The chroot is done very early in the process of starting
	#  the server.  After the chroot has been performed it
	#  switches to the "user" listed below (which MUST be
	#  specified).  If "group" is specified, it switches to that
	#  group, too.  Any other groups listed for the specified
	#  "user" in "/etc/group" are also added as part of this
	#  process.
	#
	#  The current working directory (chdir / cd) is left
	#  *outside* of the chroot until all of the modules have been
	#  initialized.  This allows the "raddb" directory to be left
	#  outside of the chroot.  Once the modules have been
	#  initialized, it does a "chdir" to ${logdir}.  This means
	#  that it should be impossible to break out of the chroot.
	#
	#  If you are worried about security issues related to this
	#  use of chdir, then simply ensure that the "raddb" directory
	#  is inside of the chroot, end be sure to do "cd raddb"
	#  BEFORE starting the server.
	#
	#  If the server is statically linked, then the only files
	#  that have to exist in the chroot are ${run_dir} and
	#  ${logdir}.  If you do the "cd raddb" as discussed above,
	#  then the "raddb" directory has to be inside of the chroot
	#  directory, too.
	#
#	chroot = /path/to/chroot/directory

	# user/group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run radiusd as.
	#
	#   If these are commented out, the server will run as the
	#   user/group that started it.  In order to change to a
	#   different user/group, you MUST be root ( or have root
	#   privileges ) to start the server.
	#
	#   We STRONGLY recommend that you run the server with as few
	#   permissions as possible.  That is, if you're not using
	#   shadow passwords, the user and group items below should be
	#   set to radius'.
	#
	#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(group) when the
	#  value of (unsigned)group is above 60000; don't use group
	#  "nobody" on these systems!
	#
	#  On systems with shadow passwords, you might have to set
	#  'group = shadow' for the server to be able to read the
	#  shadow password file.  If you can authenticate users while
	#  in debug mode, but not in daemon mode, it may be that the
	#  debugging mode server is running as a user that can read
	#  the shadow info, and the user listed below can not.
	#
	#  The server will also try to use "initgroups" to read
	#  /etc/groups.  It will join all groups where "user" is a
	#  member.  This can allow for some finer-grained access
	#  controls.
	#
#	user = radius
#	group = radius

	#  Core dumps are a bad thing.  This should only be set to
	#  'yes' if you're debugging a problem with the server.
	#
	#  allowed values: {no, yes}
	#
	allow_core_dumps = no

	#
	#  max_attributes: The maximum number of attributes
	#  permitted in a RADIUS packet.  Packets which have MORE
	#  than this number of attributes in them will be dropped.
	#
	#  If this number is set too low, then no RADIUS packets
	#  will be accepted.
	#
	#  If this number is set too high, then an attacker may be
	#  able to send a small number of packets which will cause
	#  the server to use all available memory on the machine.
	#
	#  Setting this number to 0 means "allow any number of attributes"
	max_attributes = 200

	#
	#  reject_delay: When sending an Access-Reject, it can be
	#  delayed for a few seconds.  This may help slow down a DoS
	#  attack.  It also helps to slow down people trying to brute-force
	#  crack a users password.
	#
	#  Setting this number to 0 means "send rejects immediately"
	#
	#  If this number is set higher than 'cleanup_delay', then the
	#  rejects will be sent at 'cleanup_delay' time, when the request
	#  is deleted from the internal cache of requests.
	#
	#  Useful ranges: 1 to 5
	reject_delay = 1

	#
	#  status_server: Whether or not the server will respond
	#  to Status-Server requests.
	#
	#  When sent a Status-Server message, the server responds with
	#  an Access-Accept or Accounting-Response packet.
	#
	#  This is mainly useful for administrators who want to "ping"
	#  the server, without adding test users, or creating fake
	#  accounting packets.
	#
	#  It's also useful when a NAS marks a RADIUS server "dead".
	#  The NAS can periodically "ping" the server with a Status-Server
	#  packet.  If the server responds, it must be alive, and the
	#  NAS can start using it for real requests.
	#
	#  See also raddb/sites-available/status
	#
	status_server = yes
}

# PROXY CONFIGURATION
#
#  proxy_requests: Turns proxying of RADIUS requests on or off.
#
#  The server has proxying turned on by default.  If your system is NOT
#  set up to proxy requests to another server, then you can turn proxying
#  off here.  This will save a small amount of resources on the server.
#
#  If you have proxying turned off, and your configuration files say
#  to proxy a request, then an error message will be logged.
#
#  To disable proxying, change the "yes" to "no", and comment the
#  $INCLUDE line.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
#proxy_requests  = yes
#$INCLUDE proxy.conf


# CLIENTS CONFIGURATION
#
#  Client configuration is defined in "clients.conf".
#

#  The 'clients.conf' file contains all of the information from the old
#  'clients' and 'naslist' configuration files.  We recommend that you
#  do NOT use 'client's or 'naslist', although they are still
#  supported.
#
#  Anything listed in 'clients.conf' will take precedence over the
#  information from the old-style configuration files.
#
#$INCLUDE clients.conf


# THREAD POOL CONFIGURATION
#
#  The thread pool is a long-lived group of threads which
#  take turns (round-robin) handling any incoming requests.
#
#  You probably want to have a few spare threads around,
#  so that high-load situations can be handled immediately.  If you
#  don't have any spare threads, then the request handling will
#  be delayed while a new thread is created, and added to the pool.
#
#  You probably don't want too many spare threads around,
#  otherwise they'll be sitting there taking up resources, and
#  not doing anything productive.
#
#  The numbers given below should be adequate for most situations.
#
thread pool {
	#  Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable
	#  ballpark figure.
	start_servers = 5

	#  Limit on the total number of servers running.
	#
	#  If this limit is ever reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it
	#  should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.  It is intended mainly as a brake to
	#  keep a runaway server from taking the system with it as it spirals
	#  down...
	#
	#  You may find that the server is regularly reaching the
	#  'max_servers' number of threads, and that increasing
	#  'max_servers' doesn't seem to make much difference.
	#
	#  If this is the case, then the problem is MOST LIKELY that
	#  your back-end databases are taking too long to respond, and
	#  are preventing the server from responding in a timely manner.
	#
	#  The solution is NOT do keep increasing the 'max_servers'
	#  value, but instead to fix the underlying cause of the
	#  problem: slow database, or 'hostname_lookups=yes'.
	#
	#  For more information, see 'max_request_time', above.
	#
	max_servers = 32

	#  Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess
	#  how many servers you need, FreeRADIUS dynamically adapts to
	#  the load it sees, that is, it tries to maintain enough
	#  servers to handle the current load, plus a few spare
	#  servers to handle transient load spikes.
	#
	#  It does this by periodically checking how many servers are
	#  waiting for a request.  If there are fewer than
	#  min_spare_servers, it creates a new spare.  If there are
	#  more than max_spare_servers, some of the spares die off.
	#  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
	#
	min_spare_servers = 3
	max_spare_servers = 10

	#  When the server receives a packet, it places it onto an
	#  internal queue, where the worker threads (configured above)
	#  pick it up for processing.  The maximum size of that queue
	#  is given here.
	#
	#  When the queue is full, any new packets will be silently
	#  discarded.
	#
	#  The most common cause of the queue being full is that the
	#  server is dependent on a slow database, and it has received
	#  a large "spike" of traffic.  When that happens, there is
	#  very little you can do other than make sure the server
	#  receives less traffic, or make sure that the database can
	#  handle the load.
	#
#	max_queue_size = 65536

	#  There may be memory leaks or resource allocation problems with
	#  the server.  If so, set this value to 300 or so, so that the
	#  resources will be cleaned up periodically.
	#
	#  This should only be necessary if there are serious bugs in the
	#  server which have not yet been fixed.
	#
	#  '0' is a special value meaning 'infinity', or 'the servers never
	#  exit'
	max_requests_per_server = 0

	#  Automatically limit the number of accounting requests.
	#  This configuration item tracks how many requests per second
	#  the server can handle.  It does this by tracking the
	#  packets/s received by the server for processing, and
	#  comparing that to the packets/s handled by the child
	#  threads.
	#

	#  If the received PPS is larger than the processed PPS, *and*
	#  the queue is more than half full, then new accounting
	#  requests are probabilistically discarded.  This lowers the
	#  number of packets that the server needs to process.  Over
	#  time, the server will "catch up" with the traffic.
	#
	#  Throwing away accounting packets is usually safe and low
	#  impact.  The NAS will retransmit them in a few seconds, or
	#  even a few minutes.  Vendors should read RFC 5080 Section 2.2.1
	#  to see how accounting packets should be retransmitted.  Using
	#  any other method is likely to cause network meltdowns.

	auto_limit_acct = no
}

# MODULE CONFIGURATION
#
#  The names and configuration of each module is located in this section.
#
#  After the modules are defined here, they may be referred to by name,
#  in other sections of this configuration file.
#
modules {
	#
	#  Each module has a configuration as follows:
	#
	#	name [ instance ] {
	#		config_item = value
	#		...
	#	}
	#
	#  The 'name' is used to load the 'rlm_name' library
	#  which implements the functionality of the module.
	#
	#  The 'instance' is optional.  To have two different instances
	#  of a module, it first must be referred to by 'name'.
	#  The different copies of the module are then created by
	#  inventing two 'instance' names, e.g. 'instance1' and 'instance2'
	#
	#  The instance names can then be used in later configuration
	#  INSTEAD of the original 'name'.  See the 'radutmp' configuration
	#  for an example.
	#

	#
	#  As of 3.0, modules are in mods-enabled/.  Files matching
	#  the regex /[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+/ are loaded.  The modules are
	#  initialized ONLY if they are referenced in a processing
	#  section, such as authorize, authenticate, accounting,
	#  pre/post-proxy, etc.
	#
	$INCLUDE mods-enabled/
}

# Instantiation
#
#  This section orders the loading of the modules.  Modules
#  listed here will get loaded BEFORE the later sections like
#  authorize, authenticate, etc. get examined.
#
#  This section is not strictly needed.  When a section like
#  authorize refers to a module, it's automatically loaded and
#  initialized.  However, some modules may not be listed in any
#  of the following sections, so they can be listed here.
#
#  Also, listing modules here ensures that you have control over
#  the order in which they are initialized.  If one module needs
#  something defined by another module, you can list them in order
#  here, and ensure that the configuration will be OK.
#
#  After the modules listed here have been loaded, all of the modules
#  in the "mods-enabled" directory will be loaded.  Loading the
#  "mods-enabled" directory means that unlike Version 2, you usually
#  don't need to list modules here.
#
instantiate {
	#
	# We list the counter module here so that it registers
	# the check_name attribute before any module which sets
	# it
#	daily

	# subsections here can be thought of as "virtual" modules.
	#
	# e.g. If you have two redundant SQL servers, and you want to
	# use them in the authorize and accounting sections, you could
	# place a "redundant" block in each section, containing the
	# exact same text.  Or, you could uncomment the following
	# lines, and list "redundant_sql" in the authorize and
	# accounting sections.
	#
	#redundant redundant_sql {
	#	sql1
	#	sql2
	#}
