## radrelay.conf  -- FreeRADIUS server configuration file.

##	Use with: radiusd -n radrelay

######################################################################
#
#	This file is a sample configuration that replaces the old
#	"radrelay" program.  It is a *minimal* configuration that
#	does little more than read the detail file, and proxy the
#	packets to a home server.  If you need it to do more than
#	just replace radrelay, you will need to add additional
#	configuration.
#
#	See raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server for a
#	more complete example.  That example is intended to be run
#	as part of a larger radius configuration, where the server
#	also listens on ports 1812, etc.  The example given here
#	is a minimal example that has ONLY radrelay functionality.
#
#	See radiusd.conf for a complete description of the configuration
#	parameters used here.
