#	As of 2.0.0, FreeRADIUS supports virtual hosts using the
#	"server" section, and configuration directives.
#
#	Virtual hosts should be put into the "sites-available"
#	directory.  Soft links should be created in the "sites-enabled"
#	directory to these files.  This is done in a normal installation.
#
#	If you are using 802.1X (EAP) authentication, please see also
#	the "inner-tunnel" virtual server.  You will likely have to edit
#	that, too, for authentication to work.
#
#	$Id$
#
######################################################################
#
#	Read "man radiusd" before editing this file.  See the section
#	titled DEBUGGING.  It outlines a method where you can quickly
#	obtain the configuration you want, without running into
#	trouble.  See also "man unlang", which documents the format
#	of this file.
#
#	This configuration is designed to work in the widest possible
#	set of circumstances, with the widest possible number of
#	authentication methods.  This means that in general, you should
#	need to make very few changes to this file.
#
#	The best way to configure the server for your local system
#	is to CAREFULLY edit this file.  Most attempts to make large
#	edits to this file will BREAK THE SERVER.  Any edits should
#	be small, and tested by running the server with "radiusd -X".
#	Once the edits have been verified to work, save a copy of these
#	configuration files somewhere.  (e.g. as a "tar" file).  Then,
#	make more edits, and test, as above.
#
#	There are many "commented out" references to modules such
#	as ldap, sql, etc.  These references serve as place-holders.
#	If you need the functionality of that module, then configure
#	it in radiusd.conf, and un-comment the references to it in
#	this file.  In most cases, those small changes will result
#	in the server being able to connect to the DB, and to
#	authenticate users.

#  If you want the server to listen on additional addresses, or on
#  additional ports, you can use multiple "listen" sections.
#
#  Each section make the server listen for only one type of packet,
#  therefore authentication and accounting have to be configured in
#  different sections.
#
#  The server ignore all "listen" section if you are using '-i' and '-p'
#  on the command line.

	#               raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
	#	status  listen for Status-Server packets.  For examples,

	#  Note: "type = proxy" lets you control the source IP used for
	#        proxying packets, with some limitations:
	#
	#    * A proxy listener CANNOT be used in a virtual server section.
	#    * You should probably set "port = 0".
	#    * Any "clients" configuration will be ignored.
	#
	#  See also proxy.conf, and the "src_ipaddr" configuration entry
	#  in the sample "home_server" section.  When you specify the
	#  source IP address for packets sent to a home server, the
	#  proxy listeners are automatically created.

#  Authentication.
#
#
#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.
#  Note that it does NOT mean 'try each module in order'.  It means
#  that a module from the 'authorize' section adds a configuration
#  attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type is then
#  used to pick the appropriate module from the list below.
#

#  In general, you SHOULD NOT set the Auth-Type attribute.  The server
#  will figure it out on its own, and will do the right thing.  The
#  most common side effect of erroneously setting the Auth-Type
#  attribute is that one authentication method will work, but the
#  others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand
#  is to either forcibly reject the user (Auth-Type := Reject),
#  or to or forcibly accept the user (Auth-Type := Accept).
#
#  Note that Auth-Type := Accept will NOT work with EAP.
#
#  Please do not put "unlang" configurations into the "authenticate"
#  section.  Put them in the "post-auth" section instead.  That's what
#  the post-auth section is for.

#  When the server decides to proxy a request to a home server,
#  the proxied request is first passed through the pre-proxy
#  stage.  This stage can re-write the request, or decide to
#  cancel the proxy.
#
#  Only a few modules currently have this method.
#
pre-proxy {
	# Before proxing the request add an Operator-Name attribute identifying
	# if the operator-name is found for this client.
	# No need to uncomment this if you have already enabled this in
	# the authorize section.
#       operator-name

	#  The client requests the CUI by sending a CUI attribute
	#  containing one zero byte.
	#  Uncomment the line below if *requesting* the CUI.
#       cui

	#  Uncomment the following line if you want to change attributes
	#  as defined in the preproxy_users file.
#	files

	#  Uncomment the following line if you want to filter requests
	#  sent to remote servers based on the rules defined in the
	#  'attrs.pre-proxy' file.
#	attr_filter.pre-proxy

	#  If you want to have a log of packets proxied to a home
	#  server, un-comment the following line, and the
	#  'detail pre_proxy_log' section, above.
#	pre_proxy_log
}

#
#  When the server receives a reply to a request it proxied
#  to a home server, the request may be massaged here, in the
#  post-proxy stage.
#
post-proxy {

	#  If you want to have a log of replies from a home server,
	#  un-comment the following line, and the 'detail post_proxy_log'
	#  section, above.

	#  remote proxies based on the rules defined in the 'attrs' file.

	#
	#  If you are proxying LEAP, you MUST configure the EAP
	#  module, and you MUST list it here, in the post-proxy
	#  stage.
	#
	#  You MUST also use the 'nostrip' option in the 'realm'
	#  configuration.  Otherwise, the User-Name attribute
	#  in the proxied request will not match the user name
	#  hidden inside of the EAP packet, and the end server will
	#  reject the EAP request.

	#
	#  If the server tries to proxy a request and fails, then the
	#  request is processed through the modules in this section.
	#
	#  The main use of this section is to permit robust proxying
	#  of accounting packets.  The server can be configured to
	#  proxy accounting packets as part of normal processing.
	#  Then, if the home server goes down, accounting packets can
	#  be logged to a local "detail" file, for processing with
	#  radrelay.  When the home server comes back up, radrelay
	#  will read the detail file, and send the packets to the
	#  home server.
	#
	#  With this configuration, the server always responds to
	#  Accounting-Requests from the NAS, but only writes
	#  accounting packets to disk if the home server is down.
