#
#	Sample configuration file for dynamically updating the list
#	of RADIUS clients at run time.
#
#	Everything is keyed off of a client "network".  (e.g. 192.0.2/24)
#	This configuration lets the server know that clients within
#	that network are defined dynamically.
#
#	When the server receives a packet from an unknown IP address
#	within that network, it tries to find a dynamic definition
#	for that client.  If the definition is found, the IP address
#	(and other configuration) is added to the server's internal
#	cache of "known clients", with a configurable lifetime.
#
#	Further packets from that IP address result in the client
#	definition being found in the cache.  Once the lifetime is
#	reached, the client definition is deleted, and any new requests
#	from that client are looked up as above.
#
#	If the dynamic definition is not found, then the request is
#	treated as if it came from an unknown client.  i.e. It is
#	silently discarded.
#
#	As part of protection from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,
#	the server will add only one new client per second.  This CANNOT
#	be changed, and is NOT configurable.
