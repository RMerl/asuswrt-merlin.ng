#  If it works, you have configured the inner tunnel correctly.  To check

#
#	$ radtest -t mschap USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If that works, PEAP should work.  If that command doesn't work, then
#
#	FIX THE INNER TUNNEL CONFIGURATION SO THAT IT WORKS.
#
#  Do NOT do any PEAP tests.  It won't help.  Instead, concentrate
#  on fixing the inner tunnel configuration.  DO NOTHING ELSE.

	#  If the users are logging in with an MS-CHAP-Challenge
	#  attribute for authentication, the mschap module will find
	#  the MS-CHAP-Challenge attribute, and add 'Auth-Type := MS-CHAP'
	#  to the request, which will cause the server to then use
	#  the mschap module for authentication.

	#  Pull crypt'd passwords from /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow,

	#  Look for IPASS style 'realm/', and if not found, look for
	#  '@realm', and decide whether or not to proxy, based on

	#
	#  If you are using multiple kinds of realms, you probably
	#  want to set "ignore_null = yes" for all of them.
	#  Otherwise, when the first style of realm doesn't match,
	#  the other styles won't be checked.
	#
	#  Note that proxying the inner tunnel authentication means
	#  that the user MAY use one identity in the outer session
	#  (e.g. "anonymous", and a different one here
	#  (e.g. "user@example.com").  The inner session will then be
	#  proxied elsewhere for authentication.  If you are not
	#  careful, this means that the user can cause you to forward
	#  the authentication to another RADIUS server, and have the
	#  accounting logs *not* sent to the other server.  This makes
	#  it difficult to bill people for their network activity.
	#
	suffix
#	ntdomain

	#
	#  The "suffix" module takes care of stripping the domain
	#  (e.g. "@example.com") from the User-Name attribute, and the
	#  next few lines ensure that the request is not proxied.
	#
	#  If you want the inner tunnel request to be proxied, delete

	#  This module takes care of EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication.
	#
	#  It also sets the EAP-Type attribute in the request
	#  attribute list to the EAP type from the packet.
	#
	#  The example below uses module failover to avoid querying all
	#  of the following modules if the EAP module returns "ok".
	#  Therefore, your LDAP and/or SQL servers will not be queried
	#  for the many packets that go back and forth to set up TTLS
	#  or PEAP.  The load on those servers will therefore be reduced.

	#  If no other module has claimed responsibility for

	#  other modules listed above to add a "known good" password
	#  to the request, and to do nothing else.  The PAP module
	#  will then see that password, and use it to do PAP
	#  authentication.
	#
	#  This module should be listed last, so that the other modules
	#  get a chance to set Auth-Type for themselves.

#  Authentication.
#
#
#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.
#  Note that it does NOT mean 'try each module in order'.  It means
#  that a module from the 'authorize' section adds a configuration
#  attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type is then
#  used to pick the appropriate module from the list below.
#

#  In general, you SHOULD NOT set the Auth-Type attribute.  The server
#  will figure it out on its own, and will do the right thing.  The
#  most common side effect of erroneously setting the Auth-Type
#  attribute is that one authentication method will work, but the
#  others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand
#  is to either forcibly reject the user, or forcibly accept him.

	#
	#  We do NOT recommend using this.  LDAP servers are databases.

	#  The example policy below updates the outer tunnel reply
	#  (usually Access-Accept) with the User-Name from the inner
	#  tunnel User-Name.  Since this section is processed in the
	#  context of the inner tunnel, "request" here means "inner
	#  tunnel request", and "outer.reply" means "outer tunnel
	#  reply attributes".
	#
	#  This example is most useful when the outer session contains
	#  a User-Name of "anonymous@....", or a MAC address.  If it
	#  is enabled, the NAS SHOULD use the inner tunnel User-Name
	#  in subsequent accounting packets.  This makes it easier to
	#  track user sessions, as they will all be based on the real
	#  name, and not on "anonymous".
	#
	#  The problem with doing this is that it ALSO exposes the
	#  real user name to any intermediate proxies.  People use
	#  "anonymous" identifiers outside of the tunnel for a very
	#  good reason: it gives them more privacy.  Setting the reply
	#  to contain the real user name removes ALL privacy from
	#  their session.
	#
	#  If you still want to use the inner tunnel User-Name then
	#  uncomment the section below, otherwise you may want
	#  to use  Chargeable-User-Identity attribute from RFC 4372.
	#  See further on.

	#  If you are proxying LEAP, you MUST configure the EAP

	#  You MUST also use the 'nostrip' option in the 'realm'
	#  configuration.  Otherwise, the User-Name attribute

	#  The main use of this section is to permit robust proxying
	#  of accounting packets.  The server can be configured to
	#  proxy accounting packets as part of normal processing.
	#  Then, if the home server goes down, accounting packets can
	#  be logged to a local "detail" file, for processing with
	#  radrelay.  When the home server comes back up, radrelay
	#  will read the detail file, and send the packets to the
	#  home server.
	#
	#  With this configuration, the server always responds to
	#  Accounting-Requests from the NAS, but only writes
	#  accounting packets to disk if the home server is down.
