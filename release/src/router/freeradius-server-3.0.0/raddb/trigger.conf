## trigger.conf -- Events in the server can trigger a hook to be executed.
##
##	$Id$

#
#  The triggers are named as "type.subtype.value".  These names refer
#  to subsections and then configuration items in the "trigger"
#  section below.  When an event occurs, the trigger is executed.  The
#  trigger is simply a program that is run, with optional arguments.
#
#  The server does not wait when a trigger is executed.  It is simply
#  a "one-shot" event that is sent.
#
#  The trigger names should be self-explanatory.
#

#
#  SNMP configuration.
#
#  For now, this is only for SNMP traps.
#
#  They are enabled by uncommenting (or adding) "$INCLUDE trigger.conf"
#  in the main "radiusd.conf" file.
#
#  The traps *REQUIRE* that the files in the "mibs" directory be copied
#  to the global mibs directory, usually /usr/share/snmp/mibs/.
#  If this is not done, the "snmptrap" program has no idea what information
#  to send, and will not work.  The MIB installation is *NOT* done as
#  part of the default installation, so that step *MUST* be done manually.
#
#  The global MIB directory can be found by running the following command:
#
#	snmptranslate -Dinit_mib .1.3 2>&1 | grep MIBDIR | sed "s/' .*//;s/.* '//;s/.*://"
#
#  Or maybe just:
#
#	snmptranslate -Dinit_mib .1.3 2>&1 | grep MIBDIR
#
#  If you have copied the MIBs to that directory, you can test the
#  FreeRADIUS MIBs by running the following command:
#
#	snmptranslate -m +FREERADIUS-NOTIFICATION-MIB -IR -On  serverStart
#
#  It should print out:
#
#	.1.3.6.1.4.1.11344.4.1.1
#
#  As always, run the server in debugging mode after enabling the
#  traps.  You will see the "snmptrap" command being run, and it will
#  print out any errors or issues that it encounters.  Those need to
#  be fixed before running the server in daemon mode.
#
#  We also suggest running in debugging mode as the "radiusd" user, if
#  you have "user/group" set in radiusd.conf.  The "snmptrap" program
#  may behave differently when run as "root" or as the "radiusd" user.
#
snmp {
	#
	#  Configuration for SNMP traps / notifications
	#
	#  To disable traps, edit "radiusd.conf", and delete the line
	#  which says "$INCUDE trigger.conf"
	#
	trap {
		#
		#  Absolute path for the "snmptrap" command, and
		#  default command-line arguments.
		#
		#  You can disable traps by changing the command to
		#  "/bin/echo".
		#
		cmd = "/usr/bin/snmptrap -v2c"

		#
		#  Community string
		#
		community = "public"

		#
		#  Agent configuration.
		#
		agent = "localhost ''"
	}
}

#
#  The "snmptrap" configuration defines the full command used to run the traps.
#
#  This entry should not be edited.  Instead, edit the "trap" section above.
#
snmptrap = "${snmp.trap.cmd} -c ${snmp.trap.community} ${snmp.trap.agent} FREERADIUS-NOTIFICATION-MIB"

#
#  The individual triggers are defined here.  You can disable one by
#  deleting it, or by commenting it out.  You can disable an entire
#  section of traps by deleting the section.
#
#  The entries below should not be edited.  For example, the double colons
#  *must* immediately follow the ${snmptrap} reference.  Adding a space
#  before the double colons  will break all SNMP traps.
#
#  However... the traps are just programs which are run when
#  particular events occur.  If you want to replace a trap with
#  another program, you can.  Just edit the definitions below, so that
#  they run a program of your choice.
#
#  For example, you can leverage the "start/stop" triggers to run a
#  program when the server starts, or when it stops.  But that will
#  prevent the start/stop SNMP traps from working, of course.
