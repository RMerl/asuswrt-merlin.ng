<p>
      GObject's signals have nothing to do with standard UNIX signals: they connect 
      arbitrary application-specific events with any number of listeners.
      For example, in GTK+, every user event (keystroke or mouse move) is received
      from the X server and generates a GTK+ event under the form of a signal emission
      on a given object instance.
    </p>
<p>
      Each signal is registered in the type system together with the type on which
      it can be emitted: users of the type are said to <span class="emphasis"><em>connect</em></span>
      to the signal on a given type instance when they register a closure to be 
      invoked upon the signal emission. Users can also emit the signal by themselves 
      or stop the emission of the signal from within one of the closures connected 
      to the signal.
    </p>
<p>
      When a signal is emitted on a given type instance, all the closures
      connected to this signal on this type instance will be invoked. All the closures
      connected to such a signal represent callbacks whose signature looks like:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
return_type function_callback (gpointer instance, ... , gpointer user_data);
</pre>
<p>
    </p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="signal-registration"></a>Signal registration</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
		To register a new signal on an existing type, we can use any of <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-newv" title="g_signal_newv ()">g_signal_newv</a></code>,
		<code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-new-valist" title="g_signal_new_valist ()">g_signal_new_valist</a></code> or <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-new" title="g_signal_new ()">g_signal_new</a></code> functions:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
guint g_signal_newv (const gchar        *signal_name,
                     GType               itype,
                     GSignalFlags        signal_flags,
                     GClosure           *class_closure,
                     GSignalAccumulator  accumulator,
                     gpointer            accu_data,
                     GSignalCMarshaller  c_marshaller,
                     GType               return_type,
                     guint               n_params,
                     GType              *param_types);
</pre>
<p>
		The number of parameters to these functions is a bit intimidating but they are relatively
		simple:
		</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  signal_name: is a string which can be used to uniquely identify a given signal.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  itype: is the instance type on which this signal can be emitted.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  signal_flags: partly defines the order in which closures which were connected to the
			  signal are invoked.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  class_closure: this is the default closure for the signal: if it is not NULL upon
			  the signal emission, it will be invoked upon this emission of the signal. The 
			  moment where this closure is invoked compared to other closures connected to that 
			  signal depends partly on the signal_flags.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  accumulator: this is a function pointer which is invoked after each closure
			  has been invoked. If it returns FALSE, signal emission is stopped. If it returns
			  TRUE, signal emission proceeds normally. It is also used to compute the return
			  value of the signal based on the return value of all the invoked closures.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  accumulator_data: this pointer will be passed down to each invocation of the
			  accumulator during emission.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  c_marshaller: this is the default C marshaller for any closure which is connected to
			this signal.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  return_type: this is the type of the return value of the signal.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  n_params: this is the number of parameters this signal takes.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
			  param_types: this is an array of GTypes which indicate the type of each parameter
			  of the signal. The length of this array is indicated by n_params.
			</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      </p>
<p>
		As you can see from the above definition, a signal is basically a description
		of the closures which can be connected to this signal and a description of the
		order in which the closures connected to this signal will be invoked.
	  </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="signal-connection"></a>Signal connection</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
		If you want to connect to a signal with a closure, you have three possibilities:
		</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>
		  You can register a class closure at signal registration: this is a
		  system-wide operation. i.e.: the class_closure will be invoked during each emission
		  of a given signal on all the instances of the type which supports that signal.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
		  You can use <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-override-class-closure" title="g_signal_override_class_closure ()">g_signal_override_class_closure</a></code> which
		  overrides the class_closure of a given type. It is possible to call this function
		  only on a derived type of the type on which the signal was registered.
		  This function is of use only to language bindings.
			</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
		  You can register a closure with the <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-connect" title="g_signal_connect()">g_signal_connect</a></code>
		  family of functions. This is an instance-specific operation: the closure
		  will be invoked only during emission of a given signal on a given instance.
			</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
		It is also possible to connect a different kind of callback on a given signal: 
		emission hooks are invoked whenever a given signal is emitted whatever the instance on 
		which it is emitted. Emission hooks are used for example to get all mouse_clicked
		emissions in an application to be able to emit the small mouse click sound.
		Emission hooks are connected with <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-add-emission-hook" title="g_signal_add_emission_hook ()">g_signal_add_emission_hook</a></code>
		and removed with <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-remove-emission-hook" title="g_signal_remove_emission_hook ()">g_signal_remove_emission_hook</a></code>.

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="signal-emission"></a>Signal emission</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
		Signal emission is done through the use of the <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-emit" title="g_signal_emit ()">g_signal_emit</a></code> family 
		of functions.
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">

<li class="listitem"><p>

		Internally, the GValue array is passed to the emission function proper, 
		<code class="function">signal_emit_unlocked_R</code> (implemented in <code class="filename">gsignal.c</code>).

<pre class="programlisting">
gulong     g_signal_connect_closure_by_id          (gpointer          instance,

</pre>
<p>
        The two other functions hide the detail parameter in the signal name identification:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
gulong     g_signal_connect_closure          (gpointer          instance,
                           const gchar       *detailed_signal,

</pre>
<p>
		Their detailed_signal parameter is a string which identifies the name of the signal
		to connect to. However, the format of this string is structured to look like 
		<span class="emphasis"><em>signal_name::detail_name</em></span>. Connecting to the signal
		named <span class="emphasis"><em>notify::cursor_position</em></span> will actually connect to the signal
		named <span class="emphasis"><em>notify</em></span> with the <span class="emphasis"><em>cursor_position</em></span> name.
		Internally, the detail string is transformed to a GQuark if it is present.
	  </p>
<p>
		Of the four main signal emission functions, three have an explicit detail parameter as a 
		<a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/unstable/glib-Quarks.html#GQuark"><span class="type">GQuark</span></a> again:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">

                         GQuark              detail,

                         ...);
</pre>
<p>
        The fourth function hides it in its signal name parameter:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
void                  g_signal_emit_by_name (gpointer            instance,
                         const gchar        *detailed_signal,
                         ...);
</pre>
<p>
        The format of the detailed_signal parameter is exactly the same as the format used by
        the <code class="function"><a class="link" href="gobject-Signals.html#g-signal-connect" title="g_signal_connect()">g_signal_connect</a></code> functions: <span class="emphasis"><em>signal_name::detail_name</em></span>.
	  </p>
<p>
        If a detail is provided by the user to the emission function, it is used during emission to match
        against the closures which also provide a detail.
        If the closures' detail does not match the detail provided by the user, they will not be invoked
        (even though they are connected to a signal which is being emitted).
	  </p>
<p>
		This completely optional filtering mechanism is mainly used as an optimization for signals
		which are often emitted for many different reasons: the clients can filter out which events they are
		interested in before the closure's marshalling code runs. For example, this is used extensively
		by the <span class="emphasis"><em>notify</em></span> signal of GObject: whenever a property is modified on a GObject,
		instead of just emitting the <span class="emphasis"><em>notify</em></span> signal, GObject associates as a detail to this
		signal emission the name of the property modified. This allows clients who wish to be notified of changes
		to only one property to filter most events before receiving them.
	  </p>
<p>
		As a simple rule, users can and should set the detail parameter to zero: this will disable completely
        this optional filtering.
