    <title>Closures</title>

    <para>
      Closures are central to the concept of asynchronous signal delivery
      which is widely used throughout GTK+ and GNOME applications. A closure is an 
      abstraction, a generic representation of a callback. It is a small structure
      which contains three objects:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>a function pointer (the callback itself) whose prototype looks like:
<programlisting>
return_type function_callback (... , gpointer user_data);
</programlisting>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
           the user_data pointer which is passed to the callback upon invocation of the closure
          </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
           a function pointer which represents the destructor of the closure: whenever the
           closure's refcount reaches zero, this function will be called before the closure
           structure is freed.
          </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      The <link linkend="GClosure"><type>GClosure</type></link> structure represents the common functionality of all
      closure implementations: there exists a different Closure implementation for
      each separate runtime which wants to use the GObject type system.
      <footnote><para>
        In practice, closures sit at the boundary of language runtimes: if you are
        writing Python code and one of your Python callbacks receives a signal from
        a GTK+ widget, the C code in GTK+ needs to execute your Python
        code. The closure invoked by the GTK+ object invokes the Python callback:
        it behaves as a normal C object for GTK+ and as a normal Python object for
        Python code.
      </para></footnote>
      The GObject library provides a simple <link linkend="GCClosure"><type>GCClosure</type></link> type which
      is a specific implementation of closures to be used with C/C++ callbacks.
    </para>
    <para>
      A <link linkend="GClosure"><type>GClosure</type></link> provides simple services:

          Invocation (<function><link linkend="g-closure-invoke">g_closure_invoke</link></function>): this is what closures 
          were created for: they hide the details of callback invocation from the
          callback invoker.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          Notification: the closure notifies listeners of certain events such as
          closure invocation, closure invalidation and closure finalization. Listeners
          can be registered with <function><link linkend="g-closure-add-finalize-notifier">g_closure_add_finalize_notifier</link></function>
          (finalization notification), <function><link linkend="g-closure-add-invalidate-notifier">g_closure_add_invalidate_notifier</link></function> 
          (invalidation notification) and 
          <function><link linkend="g-closure-add-marshal-guards">g_closure_add_marshal_guards</link></function> (invocation notification).
          There exist symmetric deregistration functions for finalization and invalidation
          events (<function><link linkend="g-closure-remove-finalize-notifier">g_closure_remove_finalize_notifier</link></function> and
          <function><link linkend="g-closure-remove-invalidate-notifier">g_closure_remove_invalidate_notifier</link></function>) but not for the invocation 
          process.
          <footnote><para>
            Closures are reference counted and notify listeners of their destruction in a two-stage
            process: the invalidation notifiers are invoked before the finalization notifiers.

      <title>C Closures</title>

      <para>
        If you are using C or C++
        to connect a callback to a given event, you will either use simple <link linkend="GCClosure"><type>GCClosure</type></link>s
        which have a pretty minimal API or the even simpler <function><link linkend="g-signal-connect">g_signal_connect</link></function> 
        functions (which will be presented a bit later :).
<programlisting>

      <title>Non-C closures (for the fearless)</title>

      <para>
        As was explained above, closures hide the details of callback invocation. In C,
        callback invocation is just like function invocation: it is a matter of creating
        the correct stack frame for the called function and executing a <emphasis>call</emphasis>
        assembly instruction.
      </para>
  
      <para>
        C closure marshallers transform the array of GValues which represent 
        the parameters to the target function into a C-style function parameter list, invoke
        the user-supplied C function with this new parameter list, get the return value of the
        function, transform it into a GValue and return this GValue to the marshaller caller.
      </para>
  
      <para>
        The following code implements a simple marshaller in C for a C function which takes an
        integer as first parameter and returns void.
<programlisting>
g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__INT (GClosure     *closure,
                              GValue       *return_value,
                              guint         n_param_values,
                              const GValue *param_values,
                              gpointer      invocation_hint,
                              gpointer      marshal_data)
{
  typedef void (*GMarshalFunc_VOID__INT) (gpointer     data1,
                                          gint         arg_1,
                                          gpointer     data2);
  register GMarshalFunc_VOID__INT callback;
  register GCClosure *cc = (GCClosure*) closure;
  register gpointer data1, data2;

  g_return_if_fail (n_param_values == 2);

  data1 = g_value_peek_pointer (param_values + 0);
  data2 = closure->data;

  callback = (GMarshalFunc_VOID__INT) (marshal_data ? marshal_data : cc->callback);

  callback (data1,
            g_marshal_value_peek_int (param_values + 1),
            data2);
}
</programlisting>
      </para>
  
      <para>
        Of course, there exist other kinds of marshallers. For example, James Henstridge 
        wrote a generic Python marshaller which is used by all Python closures (a Python closure
        is used to have Python-based callback be invoked by the closure invocation process).
        This Python marshaller transforms the input GValue list representing the function 
        parameters into a Python tuple which is the equivalent structure in Python (you can
        look in <function>pyg_closure_marshal</function> in <filename>pygtype.c</filename>
        in the <emphasis>pygobject</emphasis> module in the GNOME source code repository).
      </para>

  <sect1 id="signal">
    <title>Signals</title>

    <para>
      GObject's signals have nothing to do with standard UNIX signals: they connect 
      arbitrary application-specific events with any number of listeners.
      For example, in GTK+, every user event (keystroke or mouse move) is received
      from the X server and generates a GTK+ event under the form of a signal emission
      on a given object instance.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each signal is registered in the type system together with the type on which
      it can be emitted: users of the type are said to <emphasis>connect</emphasis>
      to the signal on a given type instance when they register a closure to be 
      invoked upon the signal emission. Users can also emit the signal by themselves 
      or stop the emission of the signal from within one of the closures connected 
      to the signal.
    </para>

    <para>
      When a signal is emitted on a given type instance, all the closures
      connected to this signal on this type instance will be invoked. All the closures
      connected to such a signal represent callbacks whose signature looks like:
<programlisting>
return_type function_callback (gpointer instance, ... , gpointer user_data);
</programlisting>
    </para>

		If you want to connect to a signal with a closure, you have three possibilities:
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem><para>
		  You can register a class closure at signal registration: this is a

		  of a given signal on all the instances of the type which supports that signal.
			</para></listitem>
		  <listitem><para>
		  You can use <function><link linkend="g-signal-override-class-closure">g_signal_override_class_closure</link></function> which
		  overrides the class_closure of a given type. It is possible to call this function
		  only on a derived type of the type on which the signal was registered.
		  This function is of use only to language bindings.
			</para></listitem>
		  <listitem><para>
		  You can register a closure with the <function><link linkend="g-signal-connect">g_signal_connect</link></function>
		  family of functions. This is an instance-specific operation: the closure
		  will be invoked only during emission of a given signal on a given instance.
			</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		It is also possible to connect a different kind of callback on a given signal: 
		emission hooks are invoked whenever a given signal is emitted whatever the instance on 
		which it is emitted. Emission hooks are used for example to get all mouse_clicked
		emissions in an application to be able to emit the small mouse click sound.
		Emission hooks are connected with <function><link linkend="g-signal-add-emission-hook">g_signal_add_emission_hook</link></function>
		and removed with <function><link linkend="g-signal-remove-emission-hook">g_signal_remove_emission_hook</link></function>.

			<footnote><para>
			  James (again!!) gives a few non-trivial examples of accumulators:
			  <quote>
				For instance, you may have an accumulator that ignores NULL returns from 
				closures, and only accumulates the non-NULL ones. Another accumulator may try
				to return the list of values returned by the closures.

		named <emphasis>notify</emphasis> with the <emphasis>cursor_position</emphasis> name.
		Internally, the detail string is transformed to a GQuark if it is present.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		Of the four main signal emission functions, three have an explicit detail parameter as a 
		<link linkend="GQuark"><type>GQuark</type></link> again:
<programlisting>
void                  g_signal_emitv        (const GValue       *instance_and_params,
                         guint               signal_id,
                         GQuark              detail,
                         GValue             *return_value);
void                  g_signal_emit_valist  (gpointer            instance,
                         guint               signal_id,
                         GQuark              detail,
                         va_list             var_args);
void                  g_signal_emit         (gpointer            instance,
                         guint               signal_id,
                         GQuark              detail,
                         ...);
</programlisting>
        The fourth function hides it in its signal name parameter:
<programlisting>
void                  g_signal_emit_by_name (gpointer            instance,
                         const gchar        *detailed_signal,
                         ...);
</programlisting>
        The format of the detailed_signal parameter is exactly the same as the format used by
        the <function><link linkend="g-signal-connect">g_signal_connect</link></function> functions: <emphasis>signal_name::detail_name</emphasis>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
        If a detail is provided by the user to the emission function, it is used during emission to match
        against the closures which also provide a detail.
        If the closures' detail does not match the detail provided by the user, they will not be invoked
        (even though they are connected to a signal which is being emitted).
	  </para>

	  <para>
		This completely optional filtering mechanism is mainly used as an optimization for signals
		which are often emitted for many different reasons: the clients can filter out which events they are
		interested in before the closure's marshalling code runs. For example, this is used extensively
		by the <emphasis>notify</emphasis> signal of GObject: whenever a property is modified on a GObject,
		instead of just emitting the <emphasis>notify</emphasis> signal, GObject associates as a detail to this
		signal emission the name of the property modified. This allows clients who wish to be notified of changes
		to only one property to filter most events before receiving them.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		As a simple rule, users can and should set the detail parameter to zero: this will disable completely
        this optional filtering.
