Before you start testing it would be good to explain how it works.

The script works in three modes:
 1. read-only (no special arguments) - suitable for read-only backends. Just 
        create the sample structure using the second mode, pack it (tar -p is 
        preffered to preserve unix modes) and put it on a reachable place.
 2. create-structure - only creates reference structure for later testing 
        in read-only mode
 3. write mode - full test suite, creates testing structure and performs all 
        read and write tests. Please note the delete/move tests are included 
        in this mode and target directory structure is unusable after the script
        is finished.


To see the list of available parameters just run 'live-g-file --help'


Notes:
 - it's advised to clean target directory first, otherwise some tests might fail
   (i.e. the tests creating testing structure)


Tested:
 - local filesystem (/tmp/...)
 - file:// uri (file:///tmp/...)
 - locatest:// gvfs backend (localtest:///tmp/...)
 - FAT16 filesystem (no POSIX extensions)
