Inadyn, or In-a-Dyn, is a small and simple Dynamic DNS, [DDNS][], client
with HTTPS support.  Commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions,
used in off the shelf routers and Internet gateways to automate the task
of keeping your Internet name in sync with your public¹ IP address.  It
can also be used in installations with redundant (backup) connections to
the Internet.

Most people are unaware they share a pool of Internet addresses with
other users of the same Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Protocols like
DHCP, PPPoE, or PPPoA are used to give you an address and a way to
connect to the Internet, but usually not a way for others to connect to
you.  If you want to run an Internet server on such a connection you
risk losing your IP address every time you reconnect, or as in the case
of DHCP even when the lease is renegotiated.

By using a DDNS client like `inadyn` you can register an Internet name
with a DDNS provider, like [FreeDNS](http://freedns.afraid.org).  The
DDNS client updates your DNS record periodically and/or on demand when
your IP address changes.  Inadyn can maintain multiple host records with
the same IP address, use a combination of a script, the address from an
Internet-facing interface, or default to using the IP address change
detector of the DDNS provider.

__  
¹ Public IP address is the default, private addresses can also be used.


Supported Providers
-------------------

Some of these services are free of charge for non-commercial use, some
take a small fee, but also provide more domains to choose from.

The following tier-one providers have dedicated "plugins", even though
many share the original DynDNS plugin.  Below is a list of known DDNS
providers, ordered by the plugin that support them:

  * <https://freedns.afraid.org>
  * <https://www.nsupdate.info>
  * <https://duckdns.org>
  * <https://freemyip.com>
  * <https://www.dyndns.org>, <https://dyn.com>

DDNS providers not supported natively can be enabled using the custom,
or generic, DDNS plugin.  E.g. <https://www.namecheap.com>.  See below
for configuration examples.

In-A-Dyn defaults to HTTPS, but not all providers may support this, so
try disabling SSL for the update (`ssl = false`) or the checkip phase
(`checkip-ssl = false`) in the `provider` section, in case you run into
problems.

*HTTPS is enabled by default* since it protects your credentials from
being snooped and reduces the risk of someone hijacking your account.


Configuration
-------------

In-A-Dyn supports updating several DDNS servers, several accounts even on
different DDNS providers.  The following `/etc/inadyn.conf` example show
how this can be done.  To verify your configuration, without starting the
daemon, use:

    inadyn --check-config

This looks for the default `.conf` file, to check any file, use:

    inadyn --check-config -f /path/to/file.conf

### Example

    # In-A-Dyn v2.0 configuration file format
    period          = 300
    user-agent      = Mozilla/5.0

    # The FreeDNS username must be in lower case
    # The password (max 16 chars) is case sensitive
    provider freedns {
        username    = lower-case-username
        password    = case-sensitive-pwd
        hostname    = some.example.com
    }

    # We override checkip server with the In-a-dyn built-in 'default',
    # api.ipify.org, for details on this, see below.
    provider freemyip {
        password       = YOUR_TOKEN
        hostname       = YOUR_DOMAIN.freemyip.com
        checkip-server = default
    }

    provider dyn {
        ssl         = false
        username    = charlie
        password    = snoopy
        hostname    = { peanuts, woodstock }
        user-agent  = Mozilla/4.0
    }

    provider duckdns.org {
        username         = YOUR_TOKEN
        password         = noPasswordForDuckdns
        hostname         = YOUR_DOMAIN.duckdns.org
    }

    # With multiple usernames at the same provider, index with :#
    provider no-ip.com:1 {
        username    = ian
        password    = secret
        hostname    = flemming.no-ip.com
        user-agent  = inadyn/2.2
    }

    # With multiple usernames at the same provider, index with :#
    provider no-ip.com:2 {
        username       = james
        password       = bond
        hostname       = spectre.no-ip.com
        checkip-ssl    = false
        checkip-server = api.ipify.org
    }

    # With multiple usernames at the same provider, index with :#
    provider no-ip.com:3 {
        username        = spaceman
        password        = bowie
        hostname        = spaceman.no-ip.com
        checkip-command = "/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet6 addr'"
    }

    # Google Domains - notice use of '@' to update root entry
    provider domains.google.com:1 {
        hostname = @.mydomain.com
        username = your_username
        password = your_password
    }

    # Wildcard subdomains - notice the quotes (required!)
    provider domains.google.com:2 {
        hostname = "*.mydomain.com"
        username = your_username
        password = your_password
    }

    # Note: hostname == update-key from Advanced tab in the Web UI
    provider tunnelbroker.net {
        username    = futurekid
        password    = dreoadsad/+dsad21321    # update-key-in-advanced-tab
        hostname    = 1234534245321           # tunnel-id
    }

    # dynv6.com update using a custom checkip-command, which works
    # if you have access to an Internet-connected interface.  Make
    # sure to verify the command works on your system first
    allow-ipv6 = true                # required option for IPv6 atm.
    provider dynv6.com {
        username = your_token
        password = not_used
        hostname = { host1.dynv6.net, host2.dynv6.net }
        checkip-command = "/sbin/ip -6 addr | grep inet6 | awk -F '[ \t]+|/' '{print $3}' | grep -v ^::1 | grep -v ^fe80"
    }

    provider cloudxns.net {
        username = your_api_key
        password = your_secret_key
        hostname = yourhost.example.com
    }

    provider dnspod.cn {
         username = your_api_id
         password = your_api_token
         hostname = yourhost.example.com
    }

    # Create a unique custom API token with the following permissions:
    # -> Zone.Zone - Read, Zone.DNS - Edit.
    provider cloudflare.com {
        username = zone.name
        password = api_token_important_read_comment
        hostname = hostname.zone.name
        ttl = 1 # optional, value of 1 is 'automatic'.
        proxied = false # optional.
    }

Notice how the config has three different users of the No-IP provider --
this is achieved by appending a `:ID` to the provider name.

We also define a custom cache directory, default is to use `/var/cache`.
In our case `/mnt` is a system specific persistent store for caching
your IP address as reported to each provider.  Inadyn use this to ensure
you are not locked out of your account for excessive updates, which may
happen if your device Internet gateway running inadyn gets stuck in a
reboot loop, or similar.

However, for the caching mechanism to be 100% foolproof the system clock
must be set correctly -- if you have issues with the system clock not
being set properly at boot, e.g. pending receipt of an NTP message, use
the command line option `--startup-delay=SEC`.  To tell `inadyn` it is
OK to proceed before the `SEC` timeout, use `SIGUSR2`.

The last system defined is the IPv6 <https://tunnelbroker.net> service
provided by Hurricane Electric.  Here `hostname` is set to the tunnel ID
and password **must** be the *Update key* found in the *Advanced*
configuration tab.

> **Note:** the `checkip-command` for dynv6, above, is just one way to
> do it.  Here's another variant, from their own script: `ip -6
> addr list scope global $device | grep -v " fd" | sed -n 's/.*inet6
> \([0-9a-f:]\+\).*/\1/p' | head -n 1`

Sometimes the default `checkip-server` for a DDNS provider can be very
slow to respond, to this end In-a-dyn now support overriding it with a
custom one, or a custom command.  The easiest way to change it is to set
`checkip-server = default`, triggering In-a-dyn to use `api.ipify.org`,
which it also use for custom DDNS providers.  See the man pages, or the
below section, for more information.

Some providers require using a specific browser to send updates, this
can be worked around using the `user-agent = STRING` setting, as shown
above.  It is available both on a global and on a per-provider level.

**NOTE:** In a multi-user server setup, make sure to chmod your `.conf`
  to 600 (read-write only by you/root) to protect against other users
  reading your DDNS server credentials.


Custom DDNS Providers
---------------------

In addition to the default DDNS providers supported by Inadyn, custom
DDNS providers can be defined in the config file.  Use `custom {}` in
instead of the `provider {}` section used in examples above.

In-A-Dyn use HTTP basic authentication (base64 encoded) to communicate
username and password to the server.  If you do not have a username
and/or password, you can leave these fields out.  Basic authentication,
will still be used in communication with the server, but with empty
username and password.

A custom DDNS provider can be setup like this:

    custom example {
        username       = myuser
        password       = mypass
        checkip-server = checkip.example.com
        checkip-path   = /
        ddns-server    = update.example.com
        ddns-path      = "/update?hostname="
        hostname       = myhostname.example.net
    }

The following variables can be substituted into the configuration:

     %u - username
     %p - password, if HTTP basic auth is not used
     %h - hostname
     %i - IP address
    
For <https://www.namecheap.com> it can look as follows.  Notice how the
hostname syntax differs from above:

    custom namecheap {
        username    = YOURDOMAIN.TLD
        password    = mypass
        ddns-server = dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com
        ddns-path   = "/update?domain=%u&password=%p&host=%h&ip=%i"
        hostname    = { "@", "www", "test" }
    }

Here three hostnames are updated, one HTTP GET update request for every
listed hostname.  Some providers, like FreeDNS, support setting up CNAME
records (aliases) to reduce the amount of records you need to update.
FreeDNS even default to linking multiple records to the same update,
which may be very confusing if you want each DNS record to be updated
from a unique IP address -- make sure to *check your settings at the
DDNS provider*!

The generic plugin can also be used with providers that require the
client's new IP address in the update request.  Here is an example of
how this can be done if we *pretend* that <http://dyn.com> is not
supported by inadyn.  The `ddns-path` differs between providers and is
something you must figure out.  The support pages sometimes list this
under an API section, or similar.

    # This emulates dyndns.org
    custom dyn {
        username    = DYNUSERNAME
        password    = DYNPASSWORD
        ddns-server = members.dyndns.org
        ddns-path   = "/nic/update?hostname=%h.dyndns.org&myip=%i"
        hostname    = { YOURHOST, alias }
    }

Here a fully custom `ddns-path` with format specifiers are used, see the
`inadyn.conf(5)` man page for details on this.

When using the generic plugin you should first inspect the response from
the DDNS provider.  By default Inadyn looks for a `200 HTTP` response OK
code and the strings `"good"`, `"OK"`, `"true"`, or `"updated"` in the
HTTP response body.  If the DDNS provider returns something else you can
add a list of possible `ddns-response = { Arrr, kilroy }`, or just a
single `ddns-response = Cool` -- if your provider does give any response
then use `ddns-response = ""`.

If your DDNS provider does not provide you with a `checkip-server`, you
can use other services, like http://ipify.org, which is the default if
you do not specify one for your custom provider config:

    checkip-server = api.ipify.org

or even use a script or command:

    checkip-command = /sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr'

These two settings can also be used in standard `provider{}` sections.

**Note:** `hostname` is required, even if everything is encoded in the
`ddns-path`!  The given hostname is appended to the `ddns-path` used for
updates, unless you use the `append-myip` setting, in which case your IP
address will be appended instead.  When using `append-myip` you probably
need to encode your DNS hostname in the `ddns-path` instead, as is done
in the last example above.


Build & Install
---------------

### Debian/Ubuntu/Mint

For a long time, the project maintained its own `.deb` packaging and
basic apt infrastructure.  However, the increasing level of features in
In-a-dyn, and thus amount of dependencies, as well as the demands for
supporting more architectures and different distributions, the pre-built
`.deb` support has been discontinued as of v2.9.1.

The Debian project now has an active maintainer for inadyn, which is the
upstream for Ubuntu and others.  Please report issues and requests to
your respective distribution:

  * https://packages.debian.org/sid/inadyn
  * https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/inadyn

> **Note:** the project's packaging files have been moved to a separate
> [debian][] branch in the GIT repository.  It is not actively updated
> or supported for releases.  To use it, check out the branch and edit
> `debian/changelog`) to build new `.deb` files for your system.


### Docker

Automatically built images available here:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/troglobit/inadyn

A Dockerfile is provided to simplify building and running `inadyn`.

    docker build -t inadyn:latest .
    docker run --rm -v "$PWD/inadyn.conf:/etc/inadyn.conf" inadyn:latest

### Homebrew (macOS)

To run the latest stable version on macOS, type:

    brew install inadyn

To run the latest version from the master branch, install the git tap instead:

    brew install --HEAD troglobit/inadyn/inadyn

Either of these will install all dependencies.

### Building from Source

First download the latest official In-A-Dyn release from GitHub:

* https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn/releases

In-A-Dyn requires a few libraries to build.  The build system searches
for them, in their required versions, using the `pkg-config` tool:

* [libConfuse][] (3.0+)
* [LibreSSL][], [OpenSSL][], or [GnuTLS][] (which require libnettle)

They are available from most UNIX distributions as pre-built packages.
Make sure to install the `-dev` or `-devel` package of the distribution
packages when building Inadyn.  On Debian/Ubuntu (derivatives):

    $ sudo apt install gnutls-dev libconfuse-dev

To build you also need a C compiler, the `pkg-config` tool, and make:

    $ sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config

When building with HTTPS (SSL/TLS) support, make sure to also install
the `ca-certificates` package on your system, otherwise Inadyn will not
be able to validate the DDNS provider's HTTPS certificates.

### Configure & Build

The GNU Configure & Build system use `/usr/local` as the default install
prefix.  In many cases this is useful, but this means the configuration
files and cache files will also use that same prefix.  Most users have
come to expect those files in `/etc/` and `/var/run/` and configure has
a few useful options that are recommended to use:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
    $ make -j5
    $ sudo make install-strip

You may want to remove the `--prefix=/usr` option.


### SSL/TLS Support

By default inadyn tries to build with GnuTLS for HTTPS support.  GnuTLS
is the recommended SSL library to use on UNIX distributions which do not
provide OpenSSL/LibreSSL as a system library.  However, when OpenSSL or
LibreSSL is available as a system library, for example in many embedded
systems:

    ./configure --enable-openssl

To completely disable inadyn HTTPS support (not recommended!):

    ./configure --disable-ssl

For more details on the OpenSSL and GNU GPL license issue, see:

  * <https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00595.html>
  * <https://people.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl>


### Static Build

Some people want to build statically, to do this with `autoconf` add the
following `LDFLAGS=` *after* the configure script.  You may also need to
add `LIBS=...`, which will depend on your particular system:

    ./configure LDFLAGS="-static" ...


### RedHat, Fedora, CentOS

On some systems the default configure installation path, `/usr/local`,
is disabled and not searched by tools like `ldconfig` and `pkg-config`.
So if configure fails to find the libConfuse libraries, or the `.pc`
files, create the file `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf` with this content:

    /usr/local/lib

update the linker cache:

    sudo ldconfig -v |egrep libconfuse

and run the Inadyn configure script like this:

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure

### Integration with systemd

For systemd integration you need to install `pkg-config`, which helps
the Inadyn build system figure out the systemd paths.  When installed
simply call `systemctl` to enable and start `inadyn`:

    $ sudo systemctl enable inadyn.service
    $ sudo systemctl start  inadyn.service

Check that it started properly by inspecting the system log, or:

    $ sudo systemctl status inadyn.service

To stop the service:

    $ sudo systemctl stop   inadyn.service


### Embedded applications

When built into a router, some features aren't usually used and can be disabled
to save space. The configure option `--enable-reduced` will build such a
reduced-functionality binary. Currently, this disables verbose log messages and
error strings and eliminates config file checking & some backward compatibility.


Building from GIT
-----------------

If you want to contribute, or simply just try out the latest but
unreleased features, then you need to know a few things about the
[GNU build system][buildsystem]:

- `configure.ac` and a per-directory `Makefile.am` are key files
- `configure` and `Makefile.in` are generated from `autogen.sh`,
  they are not stored in GIT but automatically generated for the
  release tarballs
- `Makefile` is generated by `configure` script

To build from GIT; clone the repository and run the `autogen.sh` script.
This requires the GNU tools `automake`, `autoconf` and `libtool` to be
installed on your system.  Released tarballs do not require these tools.

    $ sudo apt install git automake autoconf

Then you can clone the repository and create the `configure` script,
which is not part of the GIT repo:

    git clone https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn.git
    cd inadyn/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make

Building from GIT requires, at least, the previously mentioned library
dependencies.  GIT sources are a moving target and are not recommended
for production systems, unless you know what you are doing!
