.SH MATCH EXTENSIONS
iptables can use extended packet matching modules
with the \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-match\fP
options, followed by the matching module name; after these, various
extra command line options become available, depending on the specific
module.  You can specify multiple extended match modules in one line,
and you can use the \fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
options after the module has been specified to receive help specific
to that module.  The extended match modules are evaluated in the order
they are specified in the rule.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-protocol\fP was specified and if and only if an
unknown option is encountered, iptables will try load a match module of the
same name as the protocol, to try making the option available.
