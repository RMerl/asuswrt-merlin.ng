This is 'iw', a tool to use nl80211.


To build iw, just enter 'make'. If that fails, set the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to allow the Makefile
to find libnl.


'iw' is currently maintained at http://git.sipsolutions.net/iw.git/,
some more documentation is available at
http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw.

Please send all patches to Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
and CC linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org for community review.
