.SH NAME
capng_get_caps_process \- get the capabilities from a process
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B #include <cap-ng.h>
.sp
int capng_get_caps_process(void);

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

capng_get_caps_process will get the capabilities and bounding set of the pid stored inside libcap-ng's state table. The default is the pid of the running process. This can be changed by using the capng_setpid function.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

This returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

.SH NOTES

If you are doing multi-threaded programming, calling this function will only get capabilities on the calling thread. If you want to get overall capabilities for a multi-threaded process, you can only do that before creating any threads. Afterwards, threads may be able to independantly set capabilities.

capng_get_caps_process needs a mounted /proc to read the current bounding set, otherwise it will fail.
