.SH "DESCRIPTION"

capng_save_state is a function that returns a pointer to the internal state of the libcap-ng library. It should be considered opaque and not for alteration directly. This function should be used when you suspect a third party library may use libcap-ng also and want to make sure it doesn't alter something important. This function is not available in the python bindings.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

This returns NULL on failure and a non-NULL pointer otherwise.

.SH NOTES

The structure returned by capng_save_state is malloc'd;  it should be free'd if not used.
