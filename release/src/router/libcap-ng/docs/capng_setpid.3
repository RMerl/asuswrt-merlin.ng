.SH NAME
capng_setpid \- set working pid
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B #include <cap-ng.h>
.sp
void capng_setpid(int pid);

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

capng_pid sets the working pid for capabilities operations. This is useful if you want to get the capabilities of a different process.

.SH NOTES

If your process calls 
.B fork
, then the child process will still have the pid of the parent process stored in libcap-ng's internal data. It is disallowed to do any kind of setcap operations because you would be crossing process boundaries. To correct this, if your program links against pthreads, then libcap-ng will use the 
.B pthread_atfork
function (as a weak symbol) to reset the pid information to the new process automatically. You are not required to link against pthreads. You can call 
.B capng_setpid
and adjust the stored pid manually.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

None.
