#+begin_quote
  OCB is covered by several patents but may be used freely by most
  software.  See http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license.htm .
  In particular license 1 is suitable for Libgcrypt: See
  http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license1.pdf for the full
  license document; it basically says:

    License 1 — License for Open-Source Software Implementations of OCB
                (Jan 9, 2013)

    Under this license, you are authorized to make, use, and
    distribute open-source software implementations of OCB. This
    license terminates for you if you sue someone over their
    open-source software implementation of OCB claiming that you have
    a patent covering their implementation.



 License for Open Source Software Implementations of OCB
 January 9, 2013

 1 Definitions

 1.1 “Licensor” means Phillip Rogaway.

 1.2 “Licensed Patents” means any patent that claims priority to United
 States Patent Application No. 09/918,615 entitled “Method and Apparatus
 for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption,” and any utility,
 divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination,
 reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the
 aforesaid patent application. This includes, but is not limited to, United
 States Patent No. 7,046,802; United States Patent No. 7,200,227; United
 States Patent No. 7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675 ; and any
 patent that issues out of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.

 1.3 “Use” means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.

 1.4 “Software Implementation” means any practice of any invention
 claimed in the Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on
 a user-programmable, general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a
 computer-readable medium storing such software. Software Implementation does
 not include, for example, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs),
 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.

 1.5 “Open Source Software” means software whose source code is published
 and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the
 source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify,
 and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or
 (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for
 public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source
 Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons
 licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9,
 2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these
 requirements for the purposes of this license.

 1.6 “Open Source Software Implementation” means a Software
 Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is
 Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include
 any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed
 Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is
 not Open Source Software.

 2 License Grant

 2.1 License. Subject to your compliance with the term s of this license,
 including the restriction set forth in Section 2.2, Licensor hereby
 grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
 non-sublicenseable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to practice
 any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents in any Open Source Software
 Implementation.

 2.2 Restriction. If you or your affiliates institute patent litigation
 (including, but not limited to, a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
 against any entity alleging that any Use authorized by this license
 infringes another patent, then any rights granted to you under this license
 automatically terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

 3 Disclaimer
 YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNLESS REQUIRED
 BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT EMBODYING ANY LICENSED
 PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUT ORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
 CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
 ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
 OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.
