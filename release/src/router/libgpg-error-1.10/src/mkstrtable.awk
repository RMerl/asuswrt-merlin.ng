# This script outputs a source file that does define the following
# symbols:
#
# static const char msgstr[];
# A string containing all messages in the list.
#
# static const int msgidx[];
# A list of index numbers, one for each message, that points to the
# beginning of the string in msgstr.
#
# msgidxof (code);
# A macro that maps code numbers to idx numbers.  If a DEFAULT MESSAGE
# is provided (see below), its index will be returned for unknown codes.
# Otherwise -1 is returned for codes that do not appear in the list.
# You can lookup the message with code CODE with:
# msgstr + msgidx[msgidxof (code)].
#
# The input file has the following format:
# CODE1	...	MESSAGE1	(code nr, <tab>, something, <tab>, msg)
# CODE2	...	MESSAGE2	(code nr, <tab>, something, <tab>, msg)
# ...
# CODEn	...	MESSAGEn	(code nr, <tab>, something, <tab>, msg)
# 	...	DEFAULT-MESSAGE	(<tab>, something, <tab>, fall-back msg)
#
# Comments (starting with # and ending at the end of the line) are removed,
# as is trailing whitespace.  The last line is optional; if no DEFAULT
# MESSAGE is given, msgidxof will return the number -1 for unknown
# index numbers.
#
# The field to be used is specified with the variable "textidx" on
# the command line.  It defaults to 2.
#
# The variable nogettext can be set to 1 to suppress gettext markers.
#
# The variable prefix can be used to prepend a string to each message.
#
# The variable pkg_namespace can be used to prepend a string to each
# variable and macro name.
