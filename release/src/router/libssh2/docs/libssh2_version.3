libssh2_version - return the libssh2 version number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libssh2.h>

const char *
libssh2_version(int required_version);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If \fIrequired_version\fP is lower than or equal to the version number of the
libssh2 in use, the version number of libssh2 is returned as a pointer to a
zero terminated string.

The \fIrequired_version\fP should be the version number as constructed by the
LIBSSH2_VERSION_NUM define in the libssh2.h public header file, which is a 24
bit number in the 0xMMmmpp format. MM for major, mm for minor and pp for patch
number.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The version number of libssh2 is returned as a pointer to a zero terminated
string or NULL if the \fIrequired_version\fP is not fulfilled.
.SH EXAMPLE
To make sure you run with the correct libssh2 version:

.nf
if(!libssh2_version(LIBSSH2_VERSION_NUM)) {
  fprintf(stderr, \&"Runtime libssh2 version too old.\&");
  exit(1);
}
.fi

Unconditionally get the version number:

.nf
printf(\&"libssh2 version: %s\&", libssh2_version(0));
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function was added in libssh2 1.1, in previous versions there way no way
to extract this info in run-time.
