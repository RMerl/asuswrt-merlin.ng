================================================================================
-->
<!-- 
================================== assignment ==================================
AssignedBy
==========
An identifier for the party assigning a piece of metadata. This can be a
string that designates the party informally (for example, a person's name),
or a pointer in the form a fragment identifier consisting of a # character
followed by the Duid of a Topic corresponding to the party.

Importance
==========
An indication of the importance the party assigning a piece of metadata
attaches to it. The value of the Importance attribute is a formal name for a
level of importance. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

Confidence
==========
An indication of the confidence with which a piece of metadata has been
assigned. The value of the Confidence attribute is a formal name for a
degree of confidence. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

HowPresent
==========
An indication of the way in which a piece of metadata applies. The value of
the HowPresent attribute is a formal name for the way the metadata applies.
Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a controlled vocabulary.

DateAndTime
===========
The date and (optionally) time at which a piece of metadata was assigned. 

Uses the format CCYYMMDDTHHMMSS{+or-}HHMM (century, year, month, day, time
separator, hours, minutes, seconds, timezone separator, hours, minutes). If
only the Date is needed, then the substring from T onwards may be omitted.
Where the offset difference is +0000 the letter suffix "Z" may alternatively be used.

This is the Basic Format defined by ISO 8601. CCYY is a 4-digit year number.
MM is a 2-digit month number. DD is a 2-digit day number. T is the letter 'T'.
HH is a 2-digit hour number (using a 24-hour clock). MM is a 2 digit minute
number. (Note that midnight may be represented as 240000 on the date
of the day that is ending, or as 000000 on the date of the day that is
beginning.)

{+or-} is the '+' character or the '-' character, and the following HHMM are
hours and minutes of offset from Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC) as defined
by ISO 8601. If the time is being expressed in UTC, then the timezone offset
may be '+0000' or '-0000'. If the time is behind UTC, the timezone separator
is '-'. If the time is ahead of UTC the timezone separator is '+'.

Example: 10:27 p.m. in New York on 31 December 2000 would be expressed as 
"20001231T222700-0500" as New York is five hours behind UTC in winter. At
the  same moment in London, the date and time would be expressed as
"20010101T032700+0000" or as "20010101T032700-0000" because in London it is
now 3:27 a.m. on 1 January 2001. At the same moment in Paris,the date and
time would be expressed as "20010101T042700+0100", because Paris is one hour
ahead of UTC  in winter and it is now 4:27 a.m. on 1 January 2001.

<!-- 
================================= formalname ===================================

FormalName
==========
A string of characters whose meaning is determined by a controlled vocabulary.
The controlled vocabulary may (but is not required to) take the form of a NewsML TopicSet.

Vocabulary
==========
The Vocabulary attribute, if present, provides a pointer to a TopicSet which is
the controlled vocabulary that can be used to resolve the meaning of the
FormalName. 

The value of the Vocabulary attribute is an http URL or a NewsML
URN, or the # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of the a
TopicSet in the current document.

If there is no Vocabulary attribute, then the controlled vocabulary to be used
is located by the following algorithm:
- Proceed to the parent of the current element.
- If it has a Catalog element as its immediate child, see whether that Catalog
  contains a Resource element whose DefaultVocabularyFor child contains an XPath
  pattern that is matched by the current element. If so, then the controlled
  vocabulary is the resource identified by that Resource element.
- If the parent does not meet the above condition, proceed to its parent and
  check the same condition.
- Continue until a vocabulary is found, or no further parent elements are
  available because the root element has been reached and it too fails to meet
  the condition.

(The comment on Vocabulary was changed for Version 1.2)

Scheme
======
The Scheme attribute, if present, serves to distinguish which of possibly
multiple naming schemes in the controlled vocabulary is the one that governs
this FormalName. 

(The following lines added for Version 1.2)
More information about the processing of those attributes can be found in the 
NewsML Functional Specifications and the NewsML Implementation Guidelines.

<!-- 
=================================== localid ====================================

Duid
====
Duid is a "Document-unique Identifier". It must satisfy the rules for XML ID
attributes: it must only contain name characters, and it must start with a 
name-start character (not a digit). Its value must be unique within any NewsML
document.

Every NewsML element type has Duid as an optional attribute. Combined with the
Identifier element, providing a value for the Duid of any element in a NewsML
document makes the element globally identifiable. The Identifier element gives
global identification to the document, and the Duid provides local
identification for the element within the document.

Euid
====
Euid is an "Element-unique Identifier". Its value must be unique among elements
of the same element-type and having the same parent element.

Use of Euid attribute makes it possible to identify any NewsML element within
the context of its local branch of the NewsML document tree. This makes it
possible to copy, or include by reference, subtrees into new combinations in
ways that would break the uniqueness of Duids (thereby forcing new Duids to be
allocated), but still being able to retain the identity of each element. If
Euids are maintained at every level, it is possible to identify, for example
"The ContentItem whose Euid is abc within the NewsComponent whose Euid is def".
Such identification patterns would be preserved even after "pruning and
grafting" of subtrees.

the XPath and corresponds to the NewsComponent or ContentItem itself. By
applying the XPath pattern to each NewsComponent or ContentItem in turn within
the set of equivalents, the system can extract the data on the basis of which a
choice between the items can be made. If multiple matches to the XPath pattern
are present within the subtree that begins at the 'root', only the first match
found in document order is significant.  The optional Rank attribute allows
providers to place a numerical order on the  importance they think should be
attached to the different bases for choice.
Smaller numbers represent higher importance.

=================================== Property ===================================
A property of a NewsItem, NewsComponent, ContentItem, Topic, Location or Party. The property has a

Value
=====
A string representation of the value of a Property.

ValueRef
========
A pointer to the value of the Property. This might be a Topic in a TopicSet, or
any other piece of data. If both Value and ValueRef are provided, then ValueRef
identifies the actual value of the property, with Value simply providing a
string representation or mnemonic for it.


Example:
<Catalog>
 <Resource Duid="resource1">
  <Urn>urn:newsml:reuters.com:20001001:Physical Characteristics:3</Urn>
  <Url>www.reuters.com/vocabs/physical.xml</Url>
  <Url>www.iptc.com/vocabularies/memberdefined/reuters/physical.xml</Url>
  <DefaultVocabularyFor Scheme="short" Context="Metadata/Property[@FormalName='Width']"/>
 </Resource>
</Catalog>
...
<Property FormalName="Width" Vocabulary="#resource1">
 <Property FormalName="Unit" ValueRef="urn:newsml:iptc.org:20001006:units:1#cm"/>
 <Property FormalName="Quantity" Value="7.5"/>
</Property>

AllowedValues
=============
The AllowedValues attribute, if present, is a pointer to a controlled vocabulary
that delimits the set of allowed values for the property. This may be an http
URL, or a NewsML URN, or a fragment identifier consisting of a # charactger
followed by the Duid of an element in the current document. The pointer must
reference either a Resource element that designates an external controlled
vocabulary, or a TopicSet element, that is itself the controlled vocabulary.

AllowedScheme (added in Version 1.1)
=============
The AllowedScheme attribute, if present, distinguishes the Scheme in a controlled
vocabulary that delimits the set of allowed values for the property. For a match to be 
obtained within the controlled vocabulary both the AllowedScheme  must match the 
Scheme in the vocabulary and the Value must match the FormalName in the vocabulary. 
The use of the AllowedScheme attribute serves to indicate that the Value data is
 drawn from a controlled vocabulary rather that being an uncontrolled entry.

{x@y} means "the value of the y attribute of the x subelement of the
NewsIdentifier", with the exception that if the Update attribute of the
RevisionId element has its default value of N, it is omitted from the URN.

Note that the set of characters that can be directly included within a URN 
is limited.  The allowed characters are specified by the Internet Engineering 
Task Force (IETF) in its Request For Comments (RFC) number 2141.  
This document is available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt.  
Any character that is not within the permitted URN character set must be
