.Nm lldpcli ,
.Nm lldpctl
.Nd control LLDP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl u Ar socket
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Fl c Ar file
.Op Ar command ...
.Nm lldpctl
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl u Ar socket
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Ar interfaces ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls
.Xr lldpd 8
daemon.
.Pp
When no command is specified,
.Nm
will start an interactive shell which can be used to input arbitrary
commands as if they were specified on the command line. This
interactive shell should provide completion and history support.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable more debugging information. This flag can be repeated.
.It Fl u Ar socket
Specify the Unix-domain socket used for communication with
.Xr lldpd 8 .
.It Fl v
Show
.Nm
version. When repeated, show more build information.
.It Fl f Ar format
Choose the output format. Currently
.Em plain ,
.Em xml ,
.Em json ,
.Em json0
and
.Em keyvalue
formats are available. The default is
.Em plain .
.Em json0
is more verbose than
.Em json
but the structure of the JSON object is not affected by the number of
interfaces or the number of neighbors. It is therefore easier to
parse.
.It Fl c Ar file
Read the given configuration file. This option may be repeated several
times. If a directory is provided, each file contained in it will be
read  if ending by
.Li .conf .
Order is alphabetical.
.El
.Pp
When invoked as
.Nm lldpctl ,
.Nm
will display detailed information about each neighbors on the
specified interfaces or on all interfaces if none are specified. This
command is mostly kept for backward compatibility with older versions.
.Pp
The following commands are supported by
.Nm .
When there is no ambiguity, the keywords can be abbreviated. For
example,
.Cd show neighbors ports eth0 summary
and
.Cd sh neigh p eth0 sum
are the same command.
.Bd -ragged -offset XX
.Cd exit
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Quit
.Nm .
.Ed

.Cd help Op ...
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Display general help or help about a command. Also, you can get help
using the completion or by pressing the
.Ic ?
key. However, completion and inline help may be unavailable if
.Nm
was compiled without readline support but
.Cd help
command is always available.
.Ed

.Cd show neighbors
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Op Cd details | summary
.Op Cd hidden
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Display information about each neighbor known by
.Xr lldpd 8
daemon. With
.Cd summary ,
only the name and the port description of each remote host will be
displayed. On the other hand, with
.Cd details ,
all available information will be displayed, giving a verbose
view. When using
.Cd hidden ,
also display remote ports hidden by the smart filter. When specifying
one or several ports, the information displayed is limited to the
given list of ports.
.Ed

.Cd show interfaces
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Op Cd details | summary
.Op Cd hidden
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Display information about each local interface known by
.Xr lldpd 8
daemon. With
.Cd summary ,
only the name and the port description of each local interface will be
displayed. On the other hand, with
.Cd details ,
all available information will be displayed, giving a verbose
view. When using
.Cd hidden ,
also display local ports hidden by the smart filter. When specifying
one or several ports, the information displayed is limited to the
given list of ports.
.Ed

.Cd show chassis
.Op Cd details | summary
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Display information about local chassis. With
.Cd summary ,
most details are skipped. On the other hand, with
.Cd details ,
all available information will be displayed, giving a verbose
view.
.Ed

.Cd watch
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Op Cd details | summary
.Op Cd hidden
.Op Cd limit Ar X
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Watch for any neighbor changes and report them as soon as they
happen. When specifying ports, the changes are only reported when
happening on the given ports.
.Cd hidden , summary
and
.Cd details
have the same meaning than previously described. If
.Cd limit
is specified,
.Nm
will exit after receiving the specified number of events.
.Ed

.Cd show configuration
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Display global configuration of
.Xr lldpd 8
daemon.
.Ed

.Cd show statistics
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Op Cd summary
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Report LLDP-related statistics, like the number of LLDPDU transmitted,
received, discarded or unrecognized. When specifying ports, only the
statistics from the given port are reported. With
.Cd summary
the statistics of each port is summed.
.Ed

.Cd update
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Make
.Xr lldpd 8
update its information and send new LLDP PDU on all interfaces.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system hostname Ar name
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Override system hostname with the provided value. By default, the
system name is the FQDN found from the resolved value of
.Ic uname -n .
As a special value, use "." (dot) to use the short hostname instead of
a FQDN.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system hostname
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Do not override system hostname and restore the use of the node name.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system description Ar description
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Override chassis description with the provided value instead of using
kernel name, node name, kernel version, build date and architecture.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system description
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Do not override chassis description and use a value computed from node
name, kernel name, kernel version, build date and architecture instead.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system chassisid Ar description
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Override chassis ID with the provided value instead of using MAC address
from one interface or host name.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system chassisid
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Do not override chassis ID and use a value computed from one of the interface
MAC address (or host name if none is found).
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system platform Ar description
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Override platform description with the provided value instead of using
kernel name. This value is currently only used for CDP.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system platform
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Do not override platform description and use the kernel name. This
option undoes the previous one.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system interface pattern Ar pattern
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Specify which interface to listen and send LLDPDU to. Without this
option,
.Nm lldpd
will use all available physical interfaces. This option can use
wildcards. Several interfaces can be specified separated by commas.
It is also possible to remove an interface by prefixing it with an
exclamation mark. It is possible to allow an interface by
prefixing it with two exclamation marks. An allowed interface beats
a forbidden interfaces which beats a simple matched interface. For
example, with
.Em eth*,!eth1,!eth2
.Nm lldpd
will only use interfaces starting by
.Em eth
with the exception of
.Em eth1
and
.Em eth2 .
While with
.Em *,!eth*,!!eth1
.Nm
will use all interfaces, except interfaces starting by
.Em eth
with the exception of
.Em eth1 .
When an exact match is found, it will circumvent some tests. For example, if
.Em eth0.12
is specified, it will be accepted even if this is a VLAN interface.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system interface pattern
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Remove any previously configured interface pattern and use all
physical interfaces. This option undoes the previous one.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system interface permanent Ar pattern
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Specify interfaces whose configuration is permanently kept by
.Nm lldpd .
By default,
.Nm lldpd
disregard any data about interfaces when they are removed from the
system (statistics, custom configuration). This option allows one to
specify a pattern similar to the interface pattern. If an interface
disappear but matches the pattern, its data is kept in memory and
reused if the interface reappear at some point. For example, on Linux,
one could use the pattern
.Em eth*,eno*,enp* ,
which should match fixed interfaces on most systems.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system interface permanent
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Remove any previously configured permanent interface pattern.  Any
interface removed from the system will be forgotten. This option
undoes the previous one.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system interface description
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Some OS allows the user to set a description for an interface. Setting
this option will enable
.Nm lldpd
to override this description with the name of the peer neighbor if one
is found or with the number of neighbors found.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system interface description
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Do not update interface description with the name of the peer
neighbor. This option undoes the previous one.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system interface promiscuous
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Enable promiscuous mode on managed interfaces.
.Pp
When the interface is not managed any more (or when quitting
.Nm lldpd ) ,
the interface is left in promiscuous mode as it is difficult to know
if someone else also put the interface in promiscuous mode.
.Pp
This option is known to be useful when the remote switch is a Cisco
2960 and the local network card features VLAN hardware
acceleration. In this case, you may not receive LLDP frames from the
remote switch. The most plausible explanation for this is the frame is
tagged with some VLAN (usually VLAN 1) and your network card is
filtering VLAN. This is not the only available solution to work-around
this problem. If you are concerned about performance issues, you can
also tag the VLAN 1 on each interface instead.
.Pp
Currently, this option has no effect on anything else than Linux. On
other OS, either disable VLAN acceleration, tag VLAN 1 or enable
promiscuous mode manually on the interface.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system interface promiscuous
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Do not set promiscuous mode on managed interfaces. This option does
not disable promiscuous mode on interfaces already using this mode.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system ip management pattern Ar pattern
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Specify the management addresses of this system. As for interfaces
(described above), this option can use wildcards and inversions.
Without this option, the first IPv4 and the first IPv6 are used. If an
exact IP address is provided, it is used as a management address
without any check. If only negative patterns are provided, only one
IPv4 and one IPv6 addresses are chosen. Otherwise, many of them can be
selected. If you want to remove IPv6 addresses, you can use
.Em !*:* .
If an interface name is matched, the first IPv4 address and the first
IPv6 address associated to this interface will be chosen.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd system ip management pattern
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Unset any specific pattern for matching management addresses. This
option undoes the previous one.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system bond-slave-src-mac-type Ar value
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Set the type of src mac in lldp frames sent on bond slaves

Valid types are:
.Bl -tag -width "XXX." -compact -offset XX
.It Sy real
Slave real mac
.It Sy zero
All zero mac
.It Sy fixed
An arbitrary fixed value
.Li ( 00:60:08:69:97:ef )
.It Sy local
Real mac with locally administered bit set. If the real mac already
has the locally administered bit set, fallback to the fixed value.
.El
.Pp
Default value for
.Nm bond-slave-src-mac-type
is
.Nm local .
Some switches may complain when using one of the two other possible
values (either because
.Li 00:00:00:00:00:00
is not a valid MAC or because the MAC address is flapping from one
port to another). Using
.Sy local
might lead to a duplicate MAC address on the network (but this is
quite unlikely).
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd system max-neighbors Ar neighbors
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Change the maximum number of neighbors accepted (for each protocol) on
an interface. This is a global value. The default is 32. This setting
only applies to future neighbors.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd lldp agent-type
.Cd nearest-bridge | nearest-non-tpmr-bridge | nearest-customer-bridge
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
The destination MAC address used to send LLDPDU allows an agent to
control the propagation of LLDPDUs. By default, the
.Li 01:80:c2:00:00:0e
MAC address is used and limit the propagation of the LLDPDU to the
nearest bridge
.Cd ( nearest-bridge ) .
To instruct
.Nm lldpd
to use the
.Li 01:80:c2:00:00:03
MAC address instead, use
.Cd nearest-nontpmr-bridge
instead.
To use the
.Li 01:80:c2:00:00:00
MAC address instead, use
.Cd nearest-customer-bridge
instead.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd lldp portidsubtype
.Cd ifname | macaddress
.Pp
.Cd configure
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Cd lldp portidsubtype
.Cd local Ar value
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Force port ID subtype. By default,
.Nm lldpd
will use the MAC address as port identifier and the interface name as
port description, unless the interface has an alias. In this case, the
interface name will be used as port identifier and the description
will be the interface alias. With this command, you can force the port
identifier to be the interface name (with
.Cd ifname ) ,
the MAC address (with
.Cd macaddress )
or a local value (with
.Cd value ) .
In the latest case, the local value should be provided.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Cd lldp portdescription
.Cd Ar description
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Force port description to the provided string.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd lldp tx-interval Ar interval
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Change transmit delay to the specified value in seconds. The transmit
delay is the delay between two transmissions of LLDP PDU. The default
value is 30 seconds. Note:
.Nm lldpd
also starts another system based refresh timer on each port to detect
changes such as a hostname. This is the value of the tx-interval
multiplied by 20.
.Pp
You can specify an
.Cd interval
value in milliseconds by appending a "ms" suffix to the figure (e.g.
"configure lldp tx-interval 1500ms" is 1.5s, not 1500s). In this case
the TTL for received and sent LLDP frames is rounded up to the next
second. Note: the effective interval can be limited by the operating
system capabilities and CPU speed.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd lldp tx-hold Ar hold
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Change transmit hold value to the specified value. This value is used
to compute the TTL of transmitted packets which is the product of this
value and of the transmit delay. The default value is 4 and therefore
the default TTL is 120 seconds.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Cd lldp
.Cd status Ar rx-and-tx | rx-only | tx-only | disabled
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Configure the administrative status of the given port. By default, all
ports are configured to be in
.Ar rx-and-tx
mode. This means they can receive and transmit LLDP frames (as well as
other protocols if needed). In
.Ar rx-only
mode, they won't emit any frames and in
.Ar tx-only
mode, they won't receive any frames. In
.Ar disabled
mode, no frame will be sent and any incoming frame will be
discarded. This setting does not override the operational mode of the
main daemon. If it is configured in receive-only mode (with the
.Fl r
flag), setting any transmit mode won't have any effect.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Op ports Ar ethX Op ,...
.Cd lldp
.Cd vlan-tx Ar vlan_id
.Op Cd prio Ar priority Op Cd dei Ar dei
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Configure the given port to send LLDP frames over a specified VLAN. With VLAN Identifier (VID) as
.Ar vlan_id ,
Priority Code Point (PCP) as
.Ar priority ,
and Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI) as
.Ar dei .
.Nm lldpd
accepts LLDP frames on all VLANs.
.Ed

.Cd configure
.Cd lldp custom-tlv
.Op Cd add | replace
.Cd oui Ar oui
.Cd subtype Ar subtype
.Op Cd oui-info Ar content
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Emit a custom TLV for OUI
.Ar oui ,
with subtype
.Ar subtype
and optionally with the bytes specified in
.Ar content .
Both
.Ar oui
and
.Ar content
should be a comma-separated list of bytes in hex format.
.Ar oui
must be exactly 3-byte long.
If
.Ar add
is specified then the TLV will be added. This is the default action.
If
.Ar replace
is specified then all TLVs with the same
.Ar oui
and
.Ar subtype
will be replaced.

.Ed

.Cd unconfigure
.Cd lldp custom-tlv
.Op Cd oui Ar oui
.Op Cd subtype Ar subtype
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
When no oui is specified, remove all previously configured custom TLV.
When OUI
.Ar oui
and subtype
.Ar subtype
is specified, remove specific instances of custom TLV.
.Ed

.Cd configure med fast-start
.Cd enable | tx-interval Ar interval
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Configure LLDP-MED fast start mechanism. When a new LLDP-MED-enabled
neighbor is detected, fast start allows
.Nm lldpd
to shorten the interval between two LLDPDU.
.Cd enable
should enable LLDP-MED fast start while
.Cd tx-interval
specifies the interval between two LLDPDU in seconds. The default
interval is 1 second. Once 4 LLDPDU have been sent, the fast start
mechanism is disabled until a new neighbor is detected.
.Ed

.Cd unconfigure med fast-start
.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Disable LLDP-MED fast start mechanism.

.Pp
The
.Cd unknown
flag tells that the network policy for the specified application type
is required by the device but is currently unknown. This is used by
Endpoint Devices, not by Network Connectivity Devices. If not
specified, the network policy for the given application type is
defined.
.Pp
When a VLAN is specified with
.Ar vlan
tells which 802.1q VLAN ID has to be advertised for the network
policy. A valid value is between 1 and 4094.
.Cd tagged
tells the VLAN should be tagged for the specified application type.
.Pp
.Ar priority
allows one to specify IEEE 802.1d / IEEE 802.1p Layer 2 Priority, also
known as Class of Service (CoS), to be used for the specified
application type. This field is usually ignored if no VLAN is
specified. The names match 802.1D-2004 standard (table G-2). Some more
recent standards may use different labels. Only the numeric values
should be relied upon. The accepted labels are:

.Bd -ragged -offset XXXXXX
Advertise the LLDP-MED POE-MDI TLV for the given ports or for all
interfaces if no port is provided.  One can act as a PD (power
consumer) or a PSE (power provider). No check is done on the validity
of the parameters while LLDP-MED requires some restrictions:
.Bl -bullet
.It
PD shall never request more power than physical 802.3af class.
.It
PD shall never draw more than the maximum power advertised by PSE.
.It
PSE shall not reduce power allocated to PD when this power is in use.
.It
PSE may request reduced power using conservation mode
.It
Being PSE or PD is a global parameter, not a per-port parameter.
.Nm
does not enforce this: a port can be set as PD or PSE. LLDP-MED also
requires for a PSE to only have one power source (primary or
backup). Again,
.Nm
does not enforce this. Each port can have its own power source. The
same applies for PD and power priority. LLDP-MED MIB does not allow
this kind of representation.
