  - Automatic hard-wrapping is no longer the default.
  - Addition of --guidestripe to draw a helpful vertical bar.
  - Meta-Up and Meta-Down scroll the screen linewise.

  - <Ctrl+Delete> wipes next word and <Shift+Ctrl+Delete> preceding word.
  - An external spell check can be undone.

Since 2.9.0:
  - The ability to filter text through an external command.
  - Better detection of paragraphs, allowing a less indented beginning.
  - Option 'set afterends' for making Ctrl+Right stop at word ends.
  - A crash handler that saves changed buffers in case of a crash.
  - Addition of the color name "normal", meaning the default color.
  - A key can be bound to a string -- any mix of text and control codes.

  - The ability to silence nanorc error messages (-q).
  - Undo/redo operations (M-U/M-E, enabled with -u).
  - Soft wrapping of text (-$).
  - Better handling of backup files: if nano can't write a backup file,
    it won't try to write the original file afterward.
  - Emergency savefiles retain ownerships and permissions when possible.
  - Performance improvements in color syntax highlighting.

Since 1.2.0:

    line (+LINE,COLUMN).
  - Smart home key (-A).
  - Creation of unique backup files in a specified directory (-C <dir>).
  - Insertion of spaces instead of a tab when Tab is pressed (-E).
  - The long option for -K is now --rebindkeypad.

  - Word searches can optionally skip over punctuation (-W).

    the ability to specify background colors without foreground colors...
  - Insertion of single-byte characters via Esc Esc <000-255>.
  - Insertion of any character via Meta-V, "Verbatim Input".
  - Workaround for the "NumLock glitch".
  - Meta-W now repeats the last search.  Wrapping is toggled via Meta-L.
  - Replacing and spell checking only selected text.

  - Scrolling the help text up and down single lines.
  - Cutting all text from the current position to the end of the file
    with one keystroke (Meta-T).

    previous word, searching for matching brackets, "Verbatim Input"...
  - "To Line" (^W^T) and "Read from Command" (^R^X) return to their parent
    menu when their keystroke is entered again (^W^T^T and ^R^X^X).
  - Automatic adding of newlines to the ends of files without them can
    now be disabled (-L).
  - Converting from and to DOS/Mac file format is now toggled only at the
    "Write File" prompt, via Meta-D and Meta-M, and the default file format
    to save in is now set depending on what format the file was originally
    in.  -D now makes nano use bold text instead of reverse video text,
    and Meta-D at the edit window now does a word/line/character count.
    -O now makes the unused second line of the screen part of the edit
    window, and Meta-O now toggles this behavior while editing.
  - Converting files that contain a mix of DOS and Mac format lines.
  - Automatic switching on of -N with binary files has been removed, as
    it causes problems with UTF-8 support.
