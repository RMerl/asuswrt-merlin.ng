A list of desired features
--------------------------

* Allow color syntaxes to apply to more than just color, so that we can
  e.g. specify a different alternate spell checker depending on which
  file type we have open.

* Add support for right-to-left text (RTL).

* Allow setting bookmarks (saved positions, not to be confused with the
  mark set via Ctrl-^) at various lines and/or columns in the buffer,
  and allow movement between them with a single keystroke?
