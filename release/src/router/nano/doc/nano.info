1 Introduction
**************

GNU ‘nano’ is a small and friendly text editor.  Besides basic text
editing, ‘nano’ offers features like undo/redo, syntax coloring,
interactive search-and-replace, auto-indentation, line numbers, word
completion, file locking, backup files, and internationalization
support.

   The original goal for ‘nano’ was to be a complete bug-for-bug
emulation of Pico.  But currently the goal is to be as compatible as is
reasonable while offering a superset of Pico’s functionality.  *Note
Pico Compatibility:: for more details on how ‘nano’ and Pico differ.

   Starting with version 4.0, ‘nano’ no longer hard-wraps an overlong
line by default.  It further uses linewise scrolling by default, and by
default includes the line below the title bar into the editing area.

   If you want the old, Pico behavior back, you can use the following
options: ‘--breaklonglines’, ‘--jumpyscrolling’, and ‘--emptyline’ (or
‘-bje’ for short).

   Please report bugs via <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano>.

2 Invoking
**********

The usual way to invoke ‘nano’ is:

     nano [FILE]

   But it is also possible to specify one or more options (see the next
section), and to edit several files in a row.  Additionally, the cursor
can be put on a specific line of a file by adding the line number with a
plus sign before the filename, and even in a specific column by adding
it with a comma.  (Negative numbers count from the end of the file or
line.)  The cursor can also be put on the first or last occurrence of a
specific string by specifying that string after ‘+/’ or ‘+?’ before the
filename.  The string can be made case sensitive and/or caused to be
interpreted as a regular expression by inserting a ‘c’ and/or ‘r’ after
the plus sign.  These search modes can be explicitly disabled by using
the uppercase variant of those letters: ‘C’ and/or ‘R’.  When the string
contains spaces, it needs to be enclosed in quotes.  A more complete
command synopsis thus is:

     nano [OPTION]... [[+LINE[,COLUMN]|+[crCR](/|?)STRING] FILE]...

   Normally, however, you set your preferred options in a ‘nanorc’ file
(*note Nanorc Files::).  And when using ‘set positionlog’ (making ‘nano’
remember the cursor position when you close a file), you will rarely
need to specify a line number.

   As a special case: when instead of a filename a dash is given, ‘nano’
will read data from standard input.  This means you can pipe the output
of a command straight into a buffer, and then edit it.


File: nano.info,  Node: Command-line Options,  Next: Editor Basics,  Prev: Invoking,  Up: Top

3 Command-line Options
**********************

‘nano’ takes the following options from the command line:

‘-A’
‘--smarthome’
     Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at
     the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the
     cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).
     If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
     beginning of the line.

‘-B’
‘--backup’
     When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the
     current filename suffixed with a tilde (‘~’).

‘-C DIRECTORY’
‘--backupdir=DIRECTORY’
     Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a
     uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved — when backups are
     enabled.  The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified
     directory.

‘-D’
‘--boldtext’
     For the interface, use bold instead of reverse video.  This will be
     overridden by setting the options ‘titlecolor’, ‘statuscolor’,
     ‘keycolor’, ‘functioncolor’, ‘numbercolor’, and/or ‘selectedcolor’
     in your nanorc file.  *Note set functioncolor:: for details.

‘-E’
‘--tabstospaces’
     Convert typed tabs to spaces.

‘-F’
‘--multibuffer’
     Read a file into a new buffer by default.

‘-G’
‘--locking’
     Enable vim-style file locking when editing files.

‘-H’
‘--historylog’
     Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and
     executed commands, so they can be easily reused in later sessions.

‘-I’
‘--ignorercfiles’
     Don’t look at the system’s nanorc file nor at the user’s nanorc.

‘-J’
‘--guidestripe’
     Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the width
     of the text.  (The color of the stripe can be changed with ‘set
     stripecolor’ in your nanorc file.)

‘-K’
‘--rawsequences’
     Interpret escape sequences directly (instead of asking ‘ncurses’ to
     translate them).  If you need this option to get your keyboard to
     work properly, please report a bug.  Using this option disables
     ‘nano’’s mouse support.

‘-L’
‘--nonewlines’
     Don’t automatically add a newline when a text does not end with
     one.  (This can cause you to save non-POSIX text files.)

‘-M’
‘--trimblanks’
     Snip trailing whitespace from the wrapped line when automatic
     hard-wrapping occurs or when text is justified.

‘-N’
‘--noconvert’
     Disable automatic conversion of files from DOS/Mac format.

‘-O’
‘--bookstyle’
     When justifying, treat any line that starts with whitespace as the
     beginning of a paragraph (unless auto-indenting is on).

‘-P’
‘--positionlog’
     For the 200 most recent files, log the last position of the cursor,
     and place it at that position again upon reopening such a file.

‘-Q "REGEX"’
‘--quotestr="REGEX"’
     Set the regular expression for matching the quoting part of a line.
     The default value is "^([ \t]*([!#%:;>|}]|//))+".  (Note that ‘\t’
     stands for a literal Tab character.)  This makes it possible to
     rejustify blocks of quoted text when composing email, and to rewrap
     blocks of line comments when writing source code.

‘-R’
‘--restricted’
     Restricted mode: don’t read or write to any file not specified on
     the command line.  This means: don’t read or write history files;
     don’t allow suspending; don’t allow spell checking; don’t allow a
     file to be appended to, prepended to, or saved under a different
     name if it already has one; and don’t make backup files.
     Restricted mode can also be activated by invoking ‘nano’ with any
     name beginning with ‘r’ (e.g. ‘rnano’).

‘-S’
‘--softwrap’
     Display over multiple screen rows lines that exceed the screen’s
     width.  (You can make this soft-wrapping occur at whitespace
     instead of rudely at the screen’s edge, by using also
     ‘--atblanks’.)  (The old short option, ‘-$’, is deprecated.)

‘-T NUMBER’
‘--tabsize=NUMBER’
     Set the displayed tab length to NUMBER columns.  The value of
     NUMBER must be greater than 0.  The default value is 8.

‘-U’
‘--quickblank’
     Do quick status-bar blanking: status-bar messages will disappear
     after 1 keystroke instead of 25.  Note that option ‘-c’
     (‘--constantshow’) overrides this.

‘-V’
‘--version’
     Show the current version number and exit.

‘-W’
‘--wordbounds’
     Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
     characters as parts of words.

‘-X "CHARACTERS"’
‘--wordchars="CHARACTERS"’
     Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric
     ones) should be considered as parts of words.  When using this
     option, you probably want to omit ‘-W’ (‘--wordbounds’).

‘-Y NAME’
‘--syntax=NAME’
     Specify the syntax to be used for highlighting.  *Note Syntax
     Highlighting:: for more info.

‘-Z’
‘--zap’
     Let an unmodified <Backspace> or <Delete> erase the marked region
     (instead of a single character, and without affecting the
     cutbuffer).

‘-a’
‘--atblanks’
     When doing soft line wrapping, wrap lines at whitespace instead of
     always at the edge of the screen.

‘-b’
‘--breaklonglines’
     Automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong.
     (This option is the opposite of ‘-w’ (‘--nowrap’) — the last one
     given takes effect.)

‘-c’
‘--constantshow’
     Constantly display the cursor position (line number, column number,
     and character number) on the status bar.  Note that this overrides
     option ‘-U’ (‘--quickblank’).

‘-d’
‘--rebinddelete’
     Interpret the Delete and Backspace keys differently so that both
     Backspace and Delete work properly.  You should only use this
     option when on your system either Backspace acts like Delete or
     Delete acts like Backspace.

‘-e’
‘--emptyline’
     Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.

‘-f FILE’
‘--rcfile=FILE’
     Read only this FILE for setting nano’s options, instead of reading
     both the system-wide and the user’s nanorc files.

‘-g’
‘--showcursor’
     Make the cursor visible in the file browser (putting it on the
     highlighted item) and in the help viewer.  Useful for braille users
     and people with poor vision.

‘-h’
‘--help’
     Show a summary of command-line options and exit.

‘-i’
‘--autoindent’
     Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
     tabs and/or spaces as the previous line (or as the next line if the
     previous line is the beginning of a paragraph).

‘-j’
‘--jumpyscrolling’
     Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.

‘-k’
‘--cutfromcursor’
     Make the ’Cut Text’ command (normally ‘^K’) cut from the current
     cursor position to the end of the line, instead of cutting the
     entire line.

‘-l’
‘--linenumbers’
     Display line numbers to the left of the text area.  (Any line with
     an anchor additionally gets a mark in the margin.)

‘-m’
‘--mouse’
     Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
     mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
     double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
     Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.  Text can
     still be selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.

‘-n’
‘--noread’
     Treat any name given on the command line as a new file.  This
     allows ‘nano’ to write to named pipes: it will start with a blank
     buffer, and will write to the pipe when the user saves the "file".
     This way ‘nano’ can be used as an editor in combination with for
     instance ‘gpg’ without having to write sensitive data to disk
     first.

‘-o DIRECTORY’
‘--operatingdir=DIRECTORY’
     Set the operating directory.  This makes ‘nano’ set up something
     similar to a chroot.

‘-p’
‘--preserve’
     Preserve the ‘^Q’ (XON) and ‘^S’ (XOFF) sequences so data being
     sent to the editor can be stopped and started.

‘-q’
‘--indicator’
     Display a "scrollbar" on the righthand side of the edit window.  It
     shows the position of the viewport in the buffer and how much of
     the buffer is covered by the viewport.

‘-r NUMBER’
‘--fill=NUMBER’
     Set the target width for justifying and automatic hard-wrapping at
     this NUMBER of columns.  If the value is 0 or less, wrapping will
     occur at the width of the screen minus NUMBER columns, allowing the
     wrap point to vary along with the width of the screen if the screen
     is resized.  The default value is -8.

‘-s "PROGRAM [ARGUMENT ...]"’
‘--speller="PROGRAM [ARGUMENT ...]"’
     Use the given program to do spell checking and correcting.  By
     default, ‘nano’ uses the command specified in the ‘SPELL’
     environment variable.  If ‘SPELL’ is not set, and ‘--speller’ is
     not specified either, then ‘nano’ uses its own interactive spell
     corrector, which requires either ‘hunspell’ or GNU ‘spell’ to be
     installed.

‘-t’
‘--saveonexit’
     Save a changed buffer without prompting (when exiting with ‘^X’).
     This can be handy when ‘nano’ is used as the composer of an email
     program.  (The old form of the long option, ‘--tempfile’, is
     deprecated.)

‘-u’
‘--unix’
     Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano’s
     default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.  (This
     option has no effect when you also use ‘--noconvert’.)

‘-v’
‘--view’
     Don’t allow the contents of the file to be altered: read-only mode.
     This mode allows the user to open also other files for viewing,
     unless ‘--restricted’ is given too.  (Note that this option should
     NOT be used in place of correct file permissions to implement a
     read-only file.)

‘-w’
‘--nowrap’
     Do not automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes
     overlong.  This is the default.  (This option is the opposite of
     ‘-b’ (‘--breaklonglines’) — the last one given takes effect.)

‘-x’
‘--nohelp’
     Expert Mode: don’t show the Shortcut List at the bottom of the
     screen.  This affects the location of the status bar as well, as in
     Expert Mode it is located at the very bottom of the editor.

     Note: When accessing the help system, Expert Mode is temporarily
     disabled to display the help-system navigation keys.

‘-y’
‘--afterends’
     Make Ctrl+Right and Ctrl+Delete stop at word ends instead of
     beginnings.

‘-z’
‘--suspendable’
     Enable the ability to suspend ‘nano’ using the system’s suspend
     keystroke (usually ‘^Z’).

4.1 Entering Text
=================

‘nano’ is a "modeless" editor.  This means that all keystrokes, with the
exception of Control and Meta sequences, enter text into the file being
edited.

   Characters not present on the keyboard can be entered in two ways:

   • For characters with a single-byte code, pressing the Esc key twice
     and then typing a three-digit decimal number (from ‘000’ to ‘255’)
     will make ‘nano’ behave as if you typed the key with that value.

   • For any possible character, pressing ‘M-V’ (Alt+V) and then typing
     a six-digit hexadecimal number (starting with ‘0’ or ‘1’) will
     enter the corresponding Unicode character into the buffer.

   For example, typing ‘Esc Esc 2 3 4’ will enter the character "ê" —
useful when writing about a French party.  Typing ‘M-V 0 0 2 2 c 4’ will
enter the symbol "⋄", a little diamond.


File: nano.info,  Node: Commands,  Next: The Cutbuffer,  Prev: Entering Text,  Up: Editor Basics

4.2 Commands
============

Commands are given by using the Control key (Ctrl, shown as ‘^’) or the
Meta key (Alt or Cmd, shown as ‘M-’).

   • A control-key sequence is entered by holding down the Ctrl key and
     pressing the desired key.

   • A meta-key sequence is entered by holding down the Meta key
     (normally the Alt key) and pressing the desired key.

   If for some reason on your system the combinations with Ctrl or Alt
do not work, you can generate them by using the Esc key.  A control-key
sequence is generated by pressing the Esc key twice and then pressing
the desired key, and a meta-key sequence by pressing the Esc key once
and then pressing the desired key.


File: nano.info,  Node: The Cutbuffer,  Next: The Mark,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Editor Basics

4.3 The Cutbuffer
=================

Text can be cut from a file, a whole line at a time, by using the ’Cut
Text’ command (default key binding: ‘^K’).  The cut line is stored in
the cutbuffer.  Consecutive strokes of ‘^K’ will add each cut line to
this buffer, but a ‘^K’ after any other keystroke will overwrite the
entire cutbuffer.

   The contents of the cutbuffer can be pasted back into the file with
the ’Uncut Text’ command (default key binding: ‘^U’).

   A line of text can be copied into the cutbuffer (without cutting it)
with the ’Copy Text’ command (default key binding: ‘M-6’).


File: nano.info,  Node: The Mark,  Next: Screen Layout,  Prev: The Cutbuffer,  Up: Editor Basics

4.4 The Mark
============

Text can be selected by first ’setting the Mark’ (default key bindings:
‘^6’ and ‘M-A’) and then moving the cursor to the other end of the
portion to be selected.  The selected portion of text will be
highlighted.  This selection can now be cut or copied in its entirety
with a single ‘^K’ or ‘M-6’.  Or the selection can be used to limit the
scope of a search-and-replace (‘^\’) or spell-checking session (‘^T’).

   On some terminals, text can be selected also by holding down ‘Shift’
while using the cursor keys.  Holding down the ‘Ctrl’ or ‘Alt’ key too
will increase the stride.  Such a selection is cancelled upon any cursor
movement where ‘Shift’ isn’t held.

   Cutting or copying selected text will toggle the mark off
automatically.  If necessary, it can be toggled off manually with
another ‘^6’ or ‘M-A’.


File: nano.info,  Node: Screen Layout,  Next: Search and Replace,  Prev: The Mark,  Up: Editor Basics

4.5 Screen Layout
=================

The default screen of nano consists of five areas.  From top to bottom
these are: the title bar, a blank line, the edit window, the status bar,
and two help lines.

   The title bar consists of three sections: left, center and right.
The section on the left displays the version of ‘nano’ being used.  The
center section displays the current filename, or "New Buffer" if the
file has not yet been named.  The section on the right displays
"Modified" if the file has been modified since it was last saved or
opened.

   The status bar is the third line from the bottom of the screen.  It
shows important and informational messages.  Any error messages that
occur from using the editor will appear on the status bar.  Any
questions that are asked of the user will be asked on the status bar,
and any user input (search strings, filenames, etc.)  will be input on
the status bar.

   The two help lines at the bottom of the screen show some of the most
essential functions of the editor.  These two lines are called the
Shortcut List.


File: nano.info,  Node: Search and Replace,  Next: Using the Mouse,  Prev: Screen Layout,  Up: Editor Basics

4.6 Search and Replace
======================

One can search the current buffer for the occurrence of any string with
the Search command (default key binding: ‘^W’).  The default search mode
is forward, case-insensitive, and for literal strings.  But one can
search backwards by pressing ‘M-B’, search case sensitively with ‘M-C’,
and interpret regular expressions in the search string with ‘M-R’.

   A regular expression in a search string always covers just one line;
it cannot span multiple lines.  And when replacing (with ‘^\’ or ‘M-R’)
the replacement string cannot contain a newline (LF).


File: nano.info,  Node: Using the Mouse,  Next: Anchors,  Prev: Search and Replace,  Up: Editor Basics

4.7 Using the Mouse
===================

When mouse support has been configured and enabled, a single mouse click
places the cursor at the indicated position.  Clicking a second time in
the same position toggles the mark.  Clicking in the shortcut list
executes the selected shortcut.  To be able to select text with the left
button, or paste text with the middle button, hold down the Shift key
during those actions.

   The mouse will work in the X Window System, and on the console when
gpm is running.


File: nano.info,  Node: Anchors,  Next: Limitations,  Prev: Using the Mouse,  Up: Editor Basics

4.8 Anchors
===========

With ‘M-Ins’ you can place an anchor (a kind of temporary bookmark) at
the current line.  With ‘M-PgUp’ and ‘M-PgDn’ you can jump to an anchor
in the backward/forward direction.  This jumping wraps around at the top
and bottom.

   When a line with an anchor is removed, the line where the cursor ends
up inherits the anchor.  After performing an operation on the entire
buffer (like formatting it, piping it through a command, or doing an
external spell check on it), any anchors that were present are gone.
And when you close the buffer, all its anchors simply disappear; they
are not saved.

   Anchors are visualized in the margin when line numbers are activated.


File: nano.info,  Node: Limitations,  Prev: Anchors,  Up: Editor Basics

4.9 Limitations
===============

The recording and playback of keyboard macros works correctly only on a
terminal emulator, not on a Linux console (VT), because the latter does
not by default distinguish modified from unmodified arrow keys.


File: nano.info,  Node: Built-in Help,  Next: The File Browser,  Prev: Editor Basics,  Up: Top

5 Built-in Help
***************

The built-in help system in ‘nano’ is available by pressing ‘^G’.  It is
fairly self-explanatory.  It documents the various parts of the editor
and the available keystrokes.  Navigation is via the ‘^Y’ (Page Up) and
‘^V’ (Page Down) keys.  ‘^X’ exits from the help system.


File: nano.info,  Node: The File Browser,  Next: Feature Toggles,  Prev: Built-in Help,  Up: Top

6 The File Browser
******************

When in the Read-File (‘^R’) or Write-Out menu (‘^O’), pressing ‘^T’
will invoke the file browser.  Here, one can navigate directories in a
graphical manner in order to find the desired file.

   Basic movement in the file browser is accomplished with the arrow and
other cursor-movement keys.  More targeted movement is accomplished by
searching, via ‘^W’ or ‘w’, or by changing directory, via ‘^_’ or ‘g’.
The behavior of the ‘Enter’ key (or ‘s’) varies by what is currently
selected.  If the currently selected object is a directory, the file
browser will enter and display the contents of the directory.  If the
object is a file, this filename and path are copied to the status bar,
and the file browser exits.


File: nano.info,  Node: Feature Toggles,  Next: Nanorc Files,  Prev: The File Browser,  Up: Top

7 Feature Toggles
*****************

Toggles allow you to change on-the-fly certain aspects of the editor
which would normally be specified via command-line options.  They are
invoked via Meta-key sequences (*note Commands:: for more info).  The
following global toggles are available:

‘Constant Cursor Position Display’
     ‘Meta-C’ toggles the ‘-c’ (‘--constantshow’) command-line option.

‘Smart Home Key’
     ‘Meta-H’ toggles the ‘-A’ (‘--smarthome’) command-line option.

‘Auto Indent’
     ‘Meta-I’ toggles the ‘-i’ (‘--autoindent’) command-line option.

‘Cut From Cursor To End-of-Line’
     ‘Meta-K’ toggles the ‘-k’ (‘--cutfromcursor’) command-line option.

‘Long-Line Wrapping’
     ‘Meta-L’ toggles the ‘-b’ (‘--breaklonglines’) command-line option.

‘Mouse Support’
     ‘Meta-M’ toggles the ‘-m’ (‘--mouse’) command-line option.

‘Line Numbers’
     ‘Meta-N’ toggles the ‘-l’ (‘--linenumbers’) command-line option.

‘Tabs To Spaces’
     ‘Meta-O’ toggles the ‘-E’ (‘--tabstospaces’) command-line option.

‘Whitespace Display’
     ‘Meta-P’ toggles the displaying of whitespace (*note Whitespace::).

‘Soft Wrapping’
     ‘Meta-S’ toggles the ‘-S’ (‘--softwrap’) command-line option.

‘Expert/No Help’
     ‘Meta-X’ toggles the ‘-x’ (‘--nohelp’) command-line option.

‘Color Syntax Highlighting’
     ‘Meta-Y’ toggles color syntax highlighting (if your nanorc defines
     syntaxes — *note Syntax Highlighting::).

‘Suspension’
     ‘Meta-Z’ toggles the ‘-z’ (‘--suspendable’) command-line option.


File: nano.info,  Node: Nanorc Files,  Next: Pico Compatibility,  Prev: Feature Toggles,  Up: Top

8 Nanorc Files
**************

The nanorc files contain the default settings for ‘nano’.  During
startup, if ‘--rcfile’ is not given, ‘nano’ will read two files: first
the system-wide settings, from ‘/etc/nanorc’ (the exact path might be
different on your system), and then the user-specific settings, either
from ‘~/.nanorc’ or from ‘$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nano/nanorc’ or from
‘.config/nano/nanorc’, whichever exists first.  If ‘--rcfile’ is given,
‘nano’ will read just the specified settings file.

   A nanorc file accepts a series of "set" and "unset" commands, which
can be used to configure ‘nano’ on startup without using command-line
options.  Additionally, there are some commands to define syntax
highlighting and to rebind keys — *note Syntax Highlighting:: and *note
Rebinding Keys::.  ‘nano’ will read one command per line.  All commands
and keywords should be written in lowercase.

   Options in nanorc files take precedence over ‘nano’’s defaults, and
command-line options override nanorc settings.  Also, options that do
not take an argument are unset by default.  So using the ‘unset’ command
is only needed when wanting to override a setting of the system’s nanorc
file in your own nanorc.  Options that take an argument cannot be unset.

   Quotes inside the CHARACTERS parameters below should not be escaped.
The last double quote on the line will be seen as the closing quote.

* Rebinding Keys::


File: nano.info,  Node: Settings,  Next: Syntax Highlighting,  Up: Nanorc Files

8.1 Settings
============

The supported settings in a nanorc file are:

‘set afterends’
     Make Ctrl+Right and Ctrl+Delete stop at word ends instead of
     beginnings.

‘set allow_insecure_backup’
     When backing up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its
     permissions can’t be (re)set due to special OS considerations.  You
     should NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.

‘set atblanks’
     When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blank
     characters (tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge of the
     screen.

‘set autoindent’
     Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
     tabs and/or spaces as the previous line (or as the next line if the
     previous line is the beginning of a paragraph).

‘set backup’
     When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the
     current filename suffixed with a tilde (‘~’).

‘set backupdir "DIRECTORY"’
     Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a
     uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved — when backups are
     enabled with ‘set backup’ or ‘--backup’ or ‘-B’.  The uniquely
     numbered files are stored in the specified directory.

‘set boldtext’
     Use bold instead of reverse video for the title bar, status bar,
     key combos, function tags, line numbers, and selected text.  This
     is overridden by setting the options ‘titlecolor’, ‘statuscolor’,
     ‘keycolor’, ‘functioncolor’, ‘numbercolor’, and/or ‘selectedcolor’.

‘set bookstyle’
     When justifying, treat any line that starts with whitespace as the
     beginning of a paragraph (unless auto-indenting is on).

‘set brackets "CHARACTERS"’
     Set the characters treated as closing brackets when justifying
     paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only closing
     punctuation (see ‘set punct’), optionally followed by the specified
     closing brackets, can end sentences.  The default value is
     ""')>]}".

‘set breaklonglines’
     Automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong.

‘set casesensitive’
     Do case-sensitive searches by default.

‘set constantshow’
     Constantly display the cursor position on the status bar.  Note
     that this overrides ‘quickblank’.

‘set cutfromcursor’
     Use cut-from-cursor-to-end-of-line by default, instead of cutting
     the whole line.

‘set emptyline’
     Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.

‘set errorcolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for the status bar when an error message
     is displayed.  The default value is brightwhite,red.  *Note set
     functioncolor:: for valid color names.

‘set fill NUMBER’
     Set the target width for justifying and automatic hard-wrapping at
     this NUMBER of columns.  If the value is 0 or less, wrapping will
     occur at the width of the screen minus NUMBER columns, allowing the
     wrap point to vary along with the width of the screen if the screen
     is resized.  The default value is -8.

‘set functioncolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for the concise function descriptions in
     the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.  Valid names for
     the foreground and background colors are: ‘red’, ‘green’, ‘blue’,
     ‘magenta’, ‘yellow’, ‘cyan’, ‘white’, and ‘black’.  Each of these
     eight names may be prefixed with the word ‘light’ to get a brighter
     version of that color.

     On terminal emulators that can do at least 256 colors, other valid
     (but unprefixable) color names are: ‘pink’, ‘purple’, ‘mauve’,
     ‘lagoon’, ‘mint’, ‘lime’, ‘peach’, ‘orange’, ‘latte’, and ‘normal’
     — where ‘normal’ means the default foreground or background color.
     Either FGCOLOR or ,BGCOLOR may be left out, and the pair may be
     preceded by ‘bold’ and/or ‘italic’ (separated by commas) to get a
     bold and/or slanting typeface, if your terminal can do those.

‘set guidestripe NUMBER’
     Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the width
     of the text.  (The color of the stripe can be changed with ‘set
     stripecolor’.)

‘set historylog’
     Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and
     executed commands, so they can be easily reused in later sessions.

‘set jumpyscrolling’
     Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.

‘set keycolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for the shortcut key combos in the two
     help lines at the bottom of the screen.  *Note set functioncolor::
     for valid color names.

‘set linenumbers’
     Display line numbers to the left of the text area.  (Any line with
     an anchor additionally gets a mark in the margin.)

‘set locking’
     Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.

‘set matchbrackets "CHARACTERS"’
     Specify the opening and closing brackets that can be found by
     bracket searches.  This may not include blank characters.  The
     opening set must come before the closing set, and the two sets must
     be in the same order.  The default value is "(<[{)>]}".

‘set morespace’
     Deprecated option since it has become the default setting.  When
     needed, use ‘unset emptyline’ instead.

‘set mouse’
     Enable mouse support, so that mouse clicks can be used to place the
     cursor, set the mark (with a double click), or execute shortcuts.

‘set multibuffer’
     When reading in a file with ‘^R’, insert it into a new buffer by
     default.

‘set noconvert’
     Don’t convert files from DOS/Mac format.

‘set nohelp’
     Don’t display the help lists at the bottom of the screen.

‘set nonewlines’
     Don’t automatically add a newline when a text does not end with
     one.  (This can cause you to save non-POSIX text files.)

‘set nopauses’
     Obsolete option.  Ignored.

‘set nowrap’
     Deprecated option since it has become the default setting.  When
     needed, use ‘unset breaklonglines’ instead.

‘set numbercolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for line numbers.  *Note set
     functioncolor:: for valid color names.

‘set operatingdir "DIRECTORY"’
     ‘nano’ will only read and write files inside "directory" and its
     subdirectories.  Also, the current directory is changed to here, so
     files are inserted from this directory.  By default, the operating
     directory feature is turned off.

‘set positionlog’
     Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions.  The
     cursor position is remembered for the 200 most-recently edited
     files.

‘set preserve’
     Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (‘^Q’ and ‘^S’).

‘set indicator’
     Display a "scrollbar" on the righthand side of the edit window.  It
     shows the position of the viewport in the buffer and how much of
     the buffer is covered by the viewport.

‘set punct "CHARACTERS"’
     Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
     paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only the
     specified closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing
     brackets (see ‘set brackets’), can end sentences.  The default
     value is "!.?".

‘set quickblank’
     Do quick status-bar blanking: status-bar messages will disappear
     after 1 keystroke instead of 25.  Note that ‘constantshow’
     overrides this.

‘set quotestr "REGEX"’
     Set the regular expression for matching the quoting part of a line.
     The default value is "^([ \t]*([!#%:;>|}]|//))+".  (Note that ‘\t’
     stands for a literal Tab character.)  This makes it possible to
     rejustify blocks of quoted text when composing email, and to rewrap
     blocks of line comments when writing source code.

‘set rawsequences’
     Interpret escape sequences directly (instead of asking ‘ncurses’ to
     translate them).  If you need this option to get your keyboard to
     work properly, please report a bug.  Using this option disables
     ‘nano’’s mouse support.

‘set rebinddelete’
     Interpret the Delete and Backspace keys differently so that both
     Backspace and Delete work properly.  You should only use this
     option when on your system either Backspace acts like Delete or
     Delete acts like Backspace.

‘set regexp’
     Do regular-expression searches by default.  Regular expressions in
     ‘nano’ are of the extended type (ERE).

‘set saveonexit’
     Save a changed buffer automatically on exit (‘^X’); don’t prompt.
     (The old form of this option, ‘set tempfile’, is deprecated.)

‘set selectedcolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for selected text.  *Note set
     functioncolor:: for valid color names.

‘set showcursor’
     Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, and
     show the cursor in the help viewer, to aid braille users and people
     with poor vision.

‘set smarthome’
     Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at
     the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the
     cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).
     If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
     beginning of the line.

‘set smooth’
     Deprecated option since it has become the default setting.  When
     needed, use ‘unset jumpyscrolling’ instead.

‘set softwrap’
     Display lines that exceed the screen’s width over multiple screen
     lines.  (You can make this soft-wrapping occur at whitespace
     instead of rudely at the screen’s edge, by using also ‘set
     atblanks’.)

‘set speller "PROGRAM [ARGUMENT ...]"’
     Use the given program to do spell checking and correcting.  *Note
     --speller:: for details.

‘set statuscolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for the status bar.  *Note set
     functioncolor:: for valid color names.

‘set stripecolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for the vertical guiding stripe.  *Note
     set functioncolor:: for valid color names.

‘set suspendable’
     Allow ‘nano’ to be suspended (with ‘^Z’ by default).

‘set tabsize NUMBER’
     Use a tab size of NUMBER columns.  The value of NUMBER must be
     greater than 0.  The default value is 8.

‘set tabstospaces’
     Convert typed tabs to spaces.

‘set titlecolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR’
     Use this color combination for the title bar.  *Note set
     functioncolor:: for valid color names.

‘set trimblanks’
     Remove trailing whitespace from wrapped lines when automatic
     hard-wrapping occurs or when text is justified.

‘set unix’
     Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano’s
     default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.  (This
     option has no effect when you also use ‘set noconvert’.)

‘set view’
     Disallow file modification: read-only mode.  This mode allows the
     user to open also other files for viewing, unless ‘--restricted’ is
     given on the command line.

‘set whitespace "CHARACTERS"’
     Set the two characters used to indicate the presence of tabs and
     spaces.  They must be single-column characters.  The default pair
     for a UTF-8 locale is "»·", and for other locales ">.".

‘set wordbounds’
     Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
     characters as part of a word.

‘set wordchars "CHARACTERS"’
     Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric
     ones) should be considered as parts of words.  When using this
     option, you probably want to unset ‘wordbounds’.

‘set zap’
     Let an unmodified <Backspace> or <Delete> erase the marked region
     (instead of a single character, and without affecting the
     cutbuffer).


File: nano.info,  Node: Syntax Highlighting,  Next: Rebinding Keys,  Prev: Settings,  Up: Nanorc Files

8.2 Syntax Highlighting
=======================

Coloring the different syntactic elements of a file is done via regular
expressions (see the ‘color’ command below).  This is inherently
imperfect, because regular expressions are not powerful enough to fully
parse a file.  Nevertheless, regular expressions can do a lot and are
easy to make, so they are a good fit for a small editor like ‘nano’.

   All regular expressions in ‘nano’ are POSIX extended regular
expressions (ERE). This means that ‘.’, ‘?’, ‘*’, ‘+’, ‘^’, ‘$’, and
several other characters are special.  The period ‘.’ matches any single
character, ‘?’ means the preceding item is optional, ‘*’ means the
preceding item may be matched zero or more times, ‘+’ means the
preceding item must be matched one or more times, ‘^’ matches the
beginning of a line, and ‘$’ the end, ‘\<’ matches the start of a word,
and ‘\>’ the end, and ‘\s’ matches a blank.  It also means that
lookahead and lookbehind are not possible.  A complete explanation can
be found in the manual of GNU grep: ‘info grep regular’.

   A separate syntax can be defined for each kind of file via the
following commands in a nanorc file:

‘syntax NAME ["FILEREGEX" ...]’
     Start the definition of a syntax with this NAME.  All subsequent
     ‘color’ and other such commands will be added to this syntax, until
     a new ‘syntax’ command is encountered.

     When ‘nano’ is run, this syntax will be automatically activated if
     the current filename matches the extended regular expression
     FILEREGEX.  Or the syntax can be explicitly activated by using the
     ‘-Y’ or ‘--syntax’ command-line option followed by the NAME.

     The ‘default’ syntax is special: it takes no FILEREGEX, and applies
     to files that don’t match any syntax’s regexes.  The ‘none’ syntax
     is reserved; specifying it on the command line is the same as not
     having a syntax at all.

‘header "REGEX" ...’
     If from all defined syntaxes no FILEREGEX matched, then compare
     this REGEX (or regexes) against the first line of the current file,
     to determine whether this syntax should be used for it.

‘magic "REGEX" ...’
     If no FILEREGEX matched and no ‘header’ regex matched either, then
     compare this REGEX (or regexes) against the result of querying the
     ‘magic’ database about the current file, to determine whether this
     syntax should be used for it.  (This functionality only works when
     ‘libmagic’ is installed on the system and will be silently ignored
     otherwise.)

‘formatter PROGRAM [ARGUMENT ...]’
     Run the given PROGRAM on the full contents of the current buffer.
     (The current buffer is written out to a temporary file, the program
     is run on it, and then the temporary file is read back in,
     replacing the contents of the buffer.)

‘linter PROGRAM [ARGUMENT ...]’
     Use the given PROGRAM to do a syntax check on the current buffer.

‘comment "STRING"’
     Use the given string for commenting and uncommenting lines.  If the
     string contains a vertical bar or pipe character (|), this
     designates bracket-style comments; for example, "/*|*/" for CSS
     files.  The characters before the pipe are prepended to the line
     and the characters after the pipe are appended at the end of the
     line.  If no pipe character is present, the full string is
     prepended; for example, "#" for Python files.  If empty double
     quotes are specified, the comment/uncomment functions are disabled;
     for example, "" for JSON. The default value is "#".

‘tabgives "STRING"’
     Make the <Tab> key produce the given STRING.  Useful for languages
     like Python that want to see only spaces for indentation.  This
     overrides the setting of the ‘tabstospaces’ option.

‘color [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR "REGEX" ...’
     Paint all pieces of text that match the extended regular expression
     "regex" with the given foreground and background colors, at least
     one of which must be specified.  Valid color names are: ‘red’,
     ‘green’, ‘blue’, ‘magenta’, ‘yellow’, ‘cyan’, ‘white’, and ‘black’.
     Each of these eight names may be prefixed with the word ‘light’ to
     get a brighter version of that color.

     On terminal emulators that can do at least 256 colors, other valid
     (but unprefixable) color names are: ‘pink’, ‘purple’, ‘mauve’,
     ‘lagoon’, ‘mint’, ‘lime’, ‘peach’, ‘orange’, ‘latte’, and ‘normal’
     — where ‘normal’ means the default foreground or background color.
     The color pair may be preceded by ‘bold’ and/or ‘italic’ (separated
     by commas) to get a bold and/or slanting typeface, if your terminal
     can do those.

     All coloring commands are applied in the order in which they are
     specified, which means that later commands can recolor stuff that
     was colored earlier.

‘icolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR "REGEX" ...’
     Same as above, except that the matching is case insensitive.

‘color [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR start="FROMRX" end="TORX"’
     Paint all pieces of text whose start matches extended regular
     expression "fromrx" and whose end matches extended regular
     expression "torx" with the given foreground and background colors,
     at least one of which must be specified.  This means that, after an
     initial instance of "fromrx", all text until the first instance of
     "torx" will be colored.  This allows syntax highlighting to span
     multiple lines.

‘icolor [bold,][italic,]FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR start="FROMRX" end="TORX"’
     Same as above, except that the matching is case insensitive.

‘include "SYNTAXFILE"’
     Read in self-contained color syntaxes from "syntaxfile".  Note that
     "syntaxfile" may contain only the above commands, from ‘syntax’ to
     ‘icolor’.

‘extendsyntax NAME COMMAND ARGUMENT ...’
     Extend the syntax previously defined as "NAME" with another
     COMMAND.  This allows you to add a new ‘color’, ‘icolor’, ‘header’,
     ‘magic’, ‘formatter’, ‘linter’, ‘comment’, or ‘tabgives’ command to
     an already defined syntax — useful when you want to slightly
     improve a syntax defined in one of the system-installed files
     (which normally are not writable).


File: nano.info,  Node: Rebinding Keys,  Prev: Syntax Highlighting,  Up: Nanorc Files

8.3 Rebinding Keys
==================

Key bindings can be changed via the following three commands in a nanorc
file:

‘bind key function menu’
     Rebinds ‘key’ to ‘function’ in the context of ‘menu’ (or in all
     menus where the function exists when ‘all’ is used).

‘bind key "string" menu’
     Makes ‘key’ produce ‘string’ in the context of ‘menu’ (or in all
     menus where the key exists when ‘all’ is used).  The ‘string’ can
     consist of text or commands or a mix of them.  (To enter a command
     into the ‘string’, precede its keystroke with ‘M-V’.)

‘unbind key menu’
     Unbinds ‘key’ from ‘menu’ (or from all menus where the key exists
     when ‘all’ is used).


   The format of ‘key’ should be one of:

     ‘^X’ —— where X is a Latin letter, or one of several ASCII
     characters (@, ], \, ^, _), or the word "Space".  Example: ‘^C’.

     ‘M-X’ —— where X is any ASCII character except [, or the word
     "Space".  Example: ‘M-8’.

     ‘Sh-M-X’ —— where X is a Latin letter.  Example: ‘Sh-M-U’.  By
     default, each Meta+letter keystroke does the same as the
     corresponding Shift+Meta+letter.  But when any Shift+Meta bind is
     made, that will no longer be the case, for all letters.

     ‘FN’ —— where N is a numeric value from 1 to 24.  Example: ‘F10’.
     (Often, ‘F13’ to ‘F24’ can be typed as ‘F1’ to ‘F12’ with Shift.)

     ‘Ins’ or ‘Del’.

   Rebinding ‘^M’ (Enter) or ‘^I’ (Tab) is probably not a good idea.
Rebinding ‘^[’ (Esc) is not possible, because its keycode is the starter
byte of Meta keystrokes and escape sequences.  Rebinding any of the
dedicated cursor-moving keys (the arrows, Home, End, PageUp and
PageDown) is not possible.  On some terminals it’s not possible to
rebind ‘^H’ (unless ‘--raw’ is used) because its keycode is identical to
that of the Backspace key.


   Valid names for the ‘function’ to be bound are:

‘help’
     Invokes the help viewer.

‘cancel’
     Cancels the current command.

‘exit’
     Exits from the program (or from the help viewer or file browser).

‘writeout’
     Writes the current buffer to disk, asking for a name.

‘savefile’
     Writes the current file to disk without prompting.

‘insert’
     Inserts a file into the current buffer (at the current cursor
     position), or into a new buffer when option ‘multibuffer’ is set.

‘whereis’
     Starts a forward search for text in the current buffer — or for
     filenames matching a string in the current list in the file
     browser.

‘wherewas’
     Starts a backward search for text in the current buffer — or for
     filenames matching a string in the current list in the file
     browser.

‘findprevious’
     Searches the next occurrence in the backward direction.

‘findnext’
     Searches the next occurrence in the forward direction.

‘replace’
     Interactively replaces text within the current buffer.

‘cut’
     Cuts and stores the current line (or the marked region).

‘copy’
     Copies the current line (or the marked region) without deleting it.

‘paste’
     Pastes the currently stored text into the current buffer at the
     current cursor position.

‘zap’
     Throws away the current line (or the marked region).  (This
     function is bound by default to <Meta+Delete>.)

‘chopwordleft’
     Deletes from the cursor position to the beginning of the preceding
     word.  (This function is bound by default to <Shift+Ctrl+Delete>.
     If your terminal produces ‘^H’ for <Ctrl+Backspace>, you can make
     <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word to the left of the cursor by
     rebinding ‘^H’ to this function.)

‘chopwordright’
     Deletes from the cursor position to the beginning of the next word.
     (This function is bound by default to <Ctrl+Delete>.)

‘cutrestoffile’
     Cuts all text from the cursor position till the end of the buffer.

‘mark’
     Sets the mark at the current position, to start selecting text.
     Or, when it is set, unsets the mark.

‘location’
     Reports the current position of the cursor in the buffer: the line,
     column, and character positions.  (The old name of this function,
     ’curpos’, is deprecated.)

‘wordcount’
     Counts the number of words, lines and characters in the current
     buffer.

‘execute’
     Prompts for a program to execute.  The program’s output will be
     inserted into the current buffer (or into a new buffer when ‘M-F’
     is toggled).

‘speller’
     Invokes a spell-checking program, either the default ‘hunspell’ or
     GNU ‘spell’, or the one defined by ‘--speller’ or ‘set speller’.

‘formatter’
     Invokes a full-buffer-processing program (if the active syntax
     defines one).

‘linter’
     Invokes a syntax-checking program (if the active syntax defines
     one).

‘justify’
     Justifies the current paragraph.  A paragraph is a group of
     contiguous lines that, apart from possibly the first line, all have
     the same indentation.  The beginning of a paragraph is detected by
     either this lone line with a differing indentation or by a
     preceding blank line.

‘fulljustify’
     Justifies the entire current buffer.

‘indent’
     Indents (shifts to the right) the currently marked text.

‘unindent’
     Unindents (shifts to the left) the currently marked text.

‘comment’
     Comments or uncomments the current line or marked lines, using the
     comment style specified in the active syntax.

‘complete’
     Completes the fragment before the cursor to a full word found
     elsewhere in the current buffer.

‘left’
     Goes left one position (in the editor or browser).

‘right’
     Goes right one position (in the editor or browser).

‘up’
     Goes one line up (in the editor or browser).

‘down’
     Goes one line down (in the editor or browser).

‘scrollup’
     Scrolls the viewport up one row (meaning that the text slides down)
     while keeping the cursor in the same text position, if possible.

‘scrolldown’
     Scrolls the viewport down one row (meaning that the text slides up)
     while keeping the cursor in the same text position, if possible.

‘center’
     Scrolls the line with the cursor to the middle of the screen.

‘prevword’
     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.

‘nextword’
     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word.

‘home’
     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

‘end’
     Moves the cursor to the end of the current line.

‘beginpara’
     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current paragraph.

‘endpara’
     Moves the cursor to the end of the current paragraph.

‘prevblock’
     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current or preceding block
     of text.  (Blocks are separated by one or more blank lines.)

‘nextblock’
     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next block of text.

‘pageup’
     Goes up one screenful.

‘pagedown’
     Goes down one screenful.

‘firstline’
     Goes to the first line of the file.

‘lastline’
     Goes to the last line of the file.

‘gotoline’
     Goes to a specific line (and column if specified).  Negative
     numbers count from the end of the file (and end of the line).

‘findbracket’
     Moves the cursor to the bracket (or brace or parenthesis, etc.)
     that matches (pairs) with the one under the cursor.  *Note set
     matchbrackets::.

‘anchor’
     Places an anchor at the current line, or removes it when already
     present.  (An anchor is visible when line numbers are activated.)

‘prevanchor’
     Goes to the first anchor before the current line.

‘nextanchor’
     Goes to the first anchor after the current line.

‘prevbuf’
     Switches to editing/viewing the previous buffer when multiple
     buffers are open.

‘nextbuf’
     Switches to editing/viewing the next buffer when multiple buffers
     are open.

‘verbatim’
     Inserts the next keystroke verbatim into the file.

‘tab’

9 Pico Compatibility
********************

‘nano’ emulates Pico quite closely, but there are some differences
between the two editors:

‘Hard-Wrapping’
     Unlike Pico, ‘nano’ does not automatically hard-wrap the current
     line when it becomes overlong during typing.  This hard-wrapping
     can be switched on with the ‘--breaklonglines’ option.  With that
     option, ‘nano’ by default breaks lines at screen width minus eight
     columns, whereas Pico does it at screen width minus six columns.
     You can make ‘nano’ do as Pico by using ‘--fill=-6’.

‘Scrolling’
     By default, ‘nano’ will scroll just one line (instead of half a
     screen) when the cursor is moved to a line that is just out of
     view.  And when paging up or down, ‘nano’ keeps the cursor in the
     same screen position as much as possible, instead of always placing
     it on the first line of the viewport.  The Pico-like behavior can
     be obtained with the ‘--jumpyscrolling’ option.

‘Edit Area’
     Pico never uses the line directly below the title bar, leaving it
     always blank.  ‘nano’ includes this line in the editing area, in
     order to not waste space, and because in this way it is slightly
     clearer where the text starts.  If you are accustomed to this line
     being empty, you can get it back with the ‘--emptyline’ option.

‘Interactive Replace’
     Instead of allowing you to replace either just one occurrence of a
     search string or all of them, ‘nano’’s replace function is
     interactive: it will pause at each found search string and query
     whether to replace this instance.  You can then choose Yes, or No
     (skip this one), or All (don’t ask any more), or Cancel (stop with
     replacing).

‘Search and Replace History’
     When the option ‘-H’ or ‘--historylog’ is given (or set in the a
     nanorc file), text entered as search or replace strings is stored.
     These strings can be accessed with the up/down arrow keys, or you
     can type the first few characters and then use ‘Tab’ to cycle
     through the matching strings.  A retrieved string can subsequently
     be edited.

‘Position History’
     When the option ‘-P’ or ‘--positionlog’ is given (or set in a
     nanorc file), ‘nano’ will store the position of the cursor when you
     close a file, and will place the cursor in that position again when
     you later reopen the file.

‘Current Cursor Position’
     The output of the "Display Cursor Position" command (‘^C’) displays
     not only the current line and character position of the cursor, but
     also (between the two) the current column position.

‘Spell Checking’
     In the internal spell checker misspelled words are sorted
     alphabetically and trimmed for uniqueness, such that the words
     ’apple’ and ’Apple’ will be prompted for correction separately.

‘Writing Selected Text to Files’
     When using the Write-Out key (‘^O’), text that has been selected
     using the marking key (‘^^’) can not just be written out to a new
     (or existing) file, it can also be appended or prepended to an
     existing file.

‘Reading Text from a Command’
     When using the Read-File key (‘^R’), ‘nano’ can not just read a
     file, it can also read the output of a command to be run (‘^X’).

‘Reading from Working Directory’
     By default, Pico will read files from the user’s home directory
     (when using ‘^R’), but it will write files to the current working
     directory (when using ‘^O’).  ‘nano’ makes this symmetrical: always
     reading from and writing to the current working directory — the
     directory that ‘nano’ was started in.

‘File Browser’
     In the file browser, ‘nano’ does not implement the Add, Copy,
     Rename, and Delete commands that Pico provides.  In ‘nano’ the
     browser is just a file browser, not a file manager.

‘Toggles’
     Many options which alter the functionality of the program can be
     "toggled" on or off using Meta key sequences, meaning the program
     does not have to be restarted to turn a particular feature on or
     off.  *Note Feature Toggles:: for a list of options that can be
     toggled.  Or see the list at the end of the main internal help text
     (‘^G’) instead.


File: nano.info,  Node: Building and Configure Options,  Prev: Pico Compatibility,  Up: Top

10 Building and Configure Options
*********************************

Building ‘nano’ from source is fairly straightforward if you are
familiar with compiling programs with autoconf support:

       tar xvzf nano-x.y.z.tar.gz
       cd nano-x.y.z
       ./configure
       make
       make install

   The possible options to ‘./configure’ are:

‘--disable-browser’
     Exclude the mini file browser that can be called with ‘^T’ when
     wanting to read or write a file.

‘--disable-color’
     Exclude support for syntax coloring.  This also eliminates the ‘-Y’
     command-line option, which allows choosing a specific syntax.

‘--disable-comment’
     Exclude the single-keystroke comment/uncomment function (‘M-3’).

‘--disable-extra’
     Exclude the Easter egg: a crawl of major contributors.

‘--disable-help’
     Exclude the help texts (‘^G’).  This makes the binary much smaller,
     but also makes it difficult for new users to learn more than very
     basic things about using the editor.

‘--disable-histories’
     Exclude the code for handling the history files: the search and
     replace strings that were used, and the cursor position at which
     each file was closed.  This also eliminates the ‘-H’ and ‘-P’
     command-line options, which switch on the logging of search/replace
     strings and cursor positions.

‘--disable-justify’
     Exclude the justify functions (‘^J’ and ‘M-J’).

‘--disable-libmagic’
     Exclude the code for using the library of magic-number tests (for
     determining the file type and thus which syntax to use for coloring
     — often the regexes for filename and header line will be enough).

‘--disable-linenumbers’
     Exclude the line-numbering function (‘M-N’).  This also eliminates
     the ‘-l’ command-line option, which turns line numbering on.

‘--disable-mouse’
     Exclude all mouse functionality.  This also eliminates the ‘-m’
     command-line option, which enables the mouse functionality.

‘--disable-multibuffer’
     Exclude support for opening multiple files at a time and switching
     between them on the fly.  This also eliminates the ‘-F’
     command-line option, which causes a file to be read into a separate
     buffer by default.

‘--disable-nanorc’
     Exclude support for reading the nanorc files at startup.  With such
     support, you can store custom settings in a system-wide and a
     per-user nanorc file rather than having to pass command-line
     options to get the desired behavior.  *Note Nanorc Files:: for more
     info.  Disabling this also eliminates the ‘-I’ command-line option,
     which inhibits the reading of nanorc files.

‘--disable-operatingdir’
     Exclude the code for setting the operating directory.  This also
     eliminates the ‘-o’ command-line option, which sets the operating
     directory.

‘--disable-speller’
     Exclude the code for spell checking.  This also eliminates the ‘-s’
     command-line option, which allows specifying an alternate spell
     checker.

‘--disable-tabcomp’
     Exclude tab completion (when nano asks for a filename or a search
     string).

‘--disable-wordcomp’
     Exclude word completion (‘^]’).

‘--disable-wrapping’
     Exclude all hard-wrapping of overlong lines.  This also eliminates
     the ‘-b’ and ‘-w’ command-line options, which switch automatic
     long-line wrapping on and off, respectively.

‘--enable-tiny’
     This option implies all of the above.  It also disables some other
     internals of the editor, like the marking code, the
     cut-to-end-of-line code, and the function toggles.  By using the
     enabling counterpart of the above options together with
     ‘--enable-tiny’, specific features can be switched back on — but a
     few cannot.

‘--enable-debug’
     Include some code for runtime debugging output.  This can get
     pretty messy, so chances are you only want this feature when you’re
     working on the nano source.

‘--disable-nls’
     Exclude Native Language support.  This will disable the use of any
     available GNU ‘nano’ translations.

‘--enable-utf8’
     Include support for reading and writing Unicode files.  This will
     require either a wide version of curses, or a UTF-8-enabled version
     of Slang.

‘--disable-utf8’
     Exclude support for reading and writing Unicode files.  Normally
     the configure script auto-detects whether to enable UTF-8 support
     or not.  You can use this or the previous option to override that
     detection.

‘--enable-altrcname=NAME’
     Use the file with the given NAME (in the user’s home directory) as
     nano’s settings file, instead of the default ‘.nanorc’.

‘--with-slang’
     Compile ‘nano’ against Slang instead of against ncurses or other
     curses libraries.
