.TH NANORC 5 "version 3.2" "November 2018"

.SH NAME
nanorc \- GNU nano's configuration file

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fInanorc\fP file contains the default settings for \fBnano\fP, a
small and friendly editor.  The file should be in Unix format, not in
DOS or Mac format.  During startup, \fBnano\fP will first read the
system-wide settings, from \fB/etc/nanorc\fP (the exact path might be
different on your system), and then the user-specific settings, either
from \fB~/.nanorc\fR or from \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fB/nano/nanorc\fR
or from \fB~/.config/nano/nanorc\fR, whichever is encountered first.

.SH OPTIONS
The configuration file accepts a series of \fBset\fP and \fBunset\fP
commands, which can be used to configure nano on startup without using
command-line options.  Additionally, there are some commands to define
syntax highlighting and to rebind keys -- see the two separate sections
on those.  \fBnano\fP reads one command per line.
.PP
Options in \fInanorc\fP files take precedence over nano's defaults, and
command-line options override \fInanorc\fP settings.  Also, options that
do not take an argument are unset by default.  So using the \fBunset\fR
command is only needed when wanting to override a setting of the system's
\fInanorc\fR file in your own \fInanorc\fR.  Options that take an
argument cannot be unset.
.PP
Below, the \fIstring\fR parameters need to be enclosed in double quotes.
Quotes inside these string parameters don't have to be escaped with
backslashes.  The last double quote in the string will be treated as its
end.  For example, for the \fBbrackets\fP option, "\fB"')>]}\fP" will
match \fB"\fP, \fB'\fP, \fB)\fP, \fB>\fP, \fB]\fP, and \fB}\fP.
.PP
The supported commands and arguments are:

.TP 3
.B set afterends
Make Ctrl+Right stop at word ends instead of beginnings.
.TP
.B set allow_insecure_backup
When backing up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its permissions
can't be (re)set due to special OS considerations.  You should
NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.
.TP
.B set atblanks
When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blank characters
(tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge of the screen.
.TP
.B set autoindent
Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs
and/or spaces as the previous line (or as the next line if the previous
line is the beginning of a paragraph).
.TP
.B set backup
When saving a file, create a backup file by adding a tilde (\fB~\fP) to
the file's name.
.TP
.B set backupdir "\fIdirectory\fP"
Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely
numbered one every time a file is saved -- when backups are enabled
with \fBset backup\fR or \fB\-\-backup\fR or \fB\-B\fR.
The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified \fIdirectory\fR.
.TP
.B set boldtext
Use bold instead of reverse video for the title bar, status bar, key combos,
function tags, line numbers, and selected text.  This can be overridden by
setting the options \fBtitlecolor\fP, \fBstatuscolor\fP, \fBkeycolor\fP,
\fBfunctioncolor\fP, \fBnumbercolor\fP, and \fBselectedcolor\fP.
.TP
.B set brackets "\fIstring\fP"
Set the characters treated as closing brackets when justifying
paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only closing
punctuation (see \fBset punct\fP), optionally followed by the specified
closing brackets, can end sentences.  The default value is "\fB"')>]}\fP".
.TP
.B set casesensitive
Do case-sensitive searches by default.
.TP
.B set constantshow
Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
This overrides the option \fBquickblank\fR.
.TP
.B set cutfromcursor
Use cut-from-cursor-to-end-of-line by default, instead of cutting the whole line.
(The old form of this option, '\fBset cut\fR', is deprecated.)
.TP
.B set errorcolor \fIfgcolor\fR,\fIbgcolor\fR
Use this color combination for the status bar when an error message is displayed.
See \fBset titlecolor\fR for valid color names.
.TP
.B set fill \fInumber\fR
Hard-wrap lines at column number \fInumber\fR.  If \fInumber\fR is 0 or less,
the maximum line length will be the screen width less \fInumber\fP columns.
The default value is \fB\-8\fR.  This option conflicts with
\fBnowrap\fR -- the last one given takes effect.
.TP
.B set functioncolor \fIfgcolor\fR,\fIbgcolor\fR
Specify the color combination to use for the function descriptions
in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.
See \fBset titlecolor\fR for more details.
.TP
.B set historylog
Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and
executed commands, so they can be easily reused in later sessions.
.TP
.B set keycolor \fIfgcolor\fR,\fIbgcolor\fR
Specify the color combination to use for the shortcut key combos
in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.
See \fBset titlecolor\fR for more details.
.TP
.B set linenumbers
Display line numbers to the left of the text area.
.TP
.B set locking
Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.
.TP
.B set matchbrackets "\fIstring\fP"
Set the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
searches.  This may not include blank characters.  The opening set must
come before the closing set, and the two sets must be in the same order.
The default value is "\fB(<[{)>]}\fP".
.TP
.B set morespace
Use the blank line below the title bar as extra editing space.
.TP
.B set mouse
Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled, mouse
clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a double
click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X Window
System, and on the console when gpm is running.  Text can still be
selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.
.TP
.B set multibuffer
When reading in a file with ^R, insert it into a new buffer by default.
.TP
.B set noconvert
Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.
.TP
.B set nohelp
Don't display the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.
.TP
.B set nonewlines
When a file does not end with a newline, don't automatically add one.
.TP
.B set nopauses
Don't pause between warnings at startup.  This means that only
the last one will be visible (when there are multiple ones).
.TP
.B set nowrap
Don't hard-wrap text at all.  This option conflicts with
\fBfill\fR -- the last one given takes effect.
.TP
.B set numbercolor \fIfgcolor\fR,\fIbgcolor\fR
Specify the color combination to use for line numbers.
See \fBset titlecolor\fR for more details.
.TP
.B set operatingdir "\fIdirectory\fP"
\fBnano\fP will only read and write files inside \fIdirectory\fP and its
subdirectories.  Also, the current directory is changed to here, so
files are inserted from this directory.  By default, the operating
directory feature is turned off.
.TP
.B set positionlog
Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions.
The cursor position is remembered for the 200 most-recently edited files.
.TP
.B set preserve
Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).
.TP
.B set punct "\fIstring\fP"
Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only the
specfified closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets
(see \fBbrackets\fP), can end sentences.  The default value is "\fB!.?\fP".
.TP
.B set quickblank
Do quick status-bar blanking: status-bar messages will disappear after 1
keystroke instead of 25.  The option \fBconstantshow\fR overrides this.
.TP
.B set quiet
Obsolete option.  Recognized but ignored.
.TP
.B set quotestr "\fIregex\fP"
The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.  This
is an extended regular expression.  The default value is
"\fB^([\ \\t]*([#:>|}]|//))+\fP".  Note that \fB\\t\fR stands for an actual
Tab character.
.TP
.B set rebinddelete
Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and Delete
work properly.  You should only need to use this option if Backspace
acts like Delete on your system.
.TP
.B set rebindkeypad
Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.  You
should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse support
won't work properly with this option enabled.
.TP
.B set regexp
Do extended regular expression searches by default.
.TP
.B set selectedcolor \fIfgcolor\fR,\fIbgcolor\fR
Specify the color combination to use for selected text.
See \fBset titlecolor\fR for more details.
.TP
.B set showcursor
Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, to aid
braille users.
.TP
.B set smarthome
Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will
jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the cursor is
already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the
line.
.TP
.B set smooth
Use smooth scrolling by default.
.TP
.B set softwrap
Enable soft line wrapping for easier viewing of very long lines.
.TP
.B set speller "\fIprogram\fP"
Use the given \fIprogram\fR to do spell checking and correcting,
instead of the built-in corrector that calls \fBspell\fR.
.TP
.B set statuscolor \fIfgcolor\fR,\fIbgcolor\fR
Specify the color combination to use for the status bar.
See \fBset titlecolor\fR for more details.
.TP
.B set suspend
Allow \fBnano\fP to be suspended.
.TP
.B set tabsize \fInumber\fR
Use a tab size of \fInumber\fR columns.  The value of \fInumber\fP must be
greater than 0.  The default value is \fB8\fR.
.TP
.B set tabstospaces
Convert typed tabs to spaces.
.TP
.B set tempfile
Save automatically on exit, don't prompt.
.TP
.B set titlecolor \fIfgcolor\fR,\fIbgcolor\fR
Specify the color combination to use for the title bar.
Valid names for the foreground and background colors are:
.BR white ", " black ", " blue ", " green ", " red ", "
.BR cyan ", " yellow ", " magenta ", and " normal
-- where \fBnormal\fR means the default foreground or background color.
The name of the foreground color may be prefixed with \fBbright\fR.
And either "\fIfgcolor\fR" or ",\fIbgcolor\fR" may be left out.
.TP
.B set trimblanks
Remove trailing whitespace from wrapped lines when automatic
hard-wrapping occurs or when text is justified.
(The old form of this option, '\fBset justifytrim\fR', is deprecated.)
.TP
.B set unix
Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano's
default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.
(This option has no effect when you also use \fBset noconvert\fR.)
.TP
.B set view
Disallow file modification: read-only mode.
This mode allows the user to open also other files for viewing,
unless \fB--restricted\fR is given on the command line.
.TP
.B set whitespace "\fIstring\fP"
Set the two characters used to indicate the presence of tabs and
spaces.  They must be single-column characters.  The default pair
for a UTF-8 locale is "\fB\[Fc]\[md]\fR", and for other locales "\fB>.\fR".
.TP
.B set wordbounds
Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
characters as parts of words.
.TP
.B set wordchars \fIstring\fP
Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric ones)
should be considered as parts of words.  This overrides the option
\fBwordbounds\fR.
.TP
.B set zap
Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region
(instead of a single character, and without affecting the cutbuffer).

.SH SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
Coloring the different syntactic elements of a file
is done via regular expressions (see the \fBcolor\fR command below).
This is inherently imperfect, because regular expressions are not
powerful enough to fully parse a file.  Nevertheless, regular
expressions can do a lot and are easy to make, so they are a
good fit for a small editor like \fBnano\fR.
.sp
For each kind of file a separate syntax can be defined
via the following commands:
.TP
.BI syntax " name \fR[" """" fileregex """ " \fR...]
Start the definition of a syntax with this \fIname\fR.
All subsequent \fBcolor\fR and other such commands
will be added to this syntax, until a new \fBsyntax\fR
command is encountered.

When \fBnano\fR is run, this syntax will be automatically
activated if the current filename matches the extended regular
expression \fIfileregex\fR.  Or the syntax can be explicitly
activated by using the \fB-Y\fR or \fB\-\-syntax\fR
command-line option followed by the \fIname\fR.

The syntax \fBdefault\fP is special: it takes no \fIfileregex\fR,
and applies to files that don't match any syntax's regexes.
The syntax \fBnone\fP is reserved; specifying it on the command line
is the same as not having a syntax at all.
.TP
.BI "header """ regex """ \fR...
If from all defined syntaxes no \fIfileregex\fR matched, then compare
this \fIregex\fR (or regexes) against the first line of the current file,
to determine whether this syntax should be used for it.
.TP
.BI "magic """ regex """ \fR...
If no \fIfileregex\fR matched and no \fBheader\fR regex matched
either, then compare this \fIregex\fR (or regexes) against the
result of querying the \fBmagic\fP database about the current
file, to determine whether this syntax should be used for it.
(This functionality only works when \fBlibmagic\fP is installed on the
system and will be silently ignored otherwise.)
.TP
.BI linter " program " \fR[ "arg " \fR...]
Use the given \fIprogram\fR to run a syntax check on the current buffer.
(This overrides the speller function.)
.TP
.BI "comment """ string """
Use the given \fIstring\fR for commenting and uncommenting lines.
If the string contains a vertical bar or pipe character (\fB|\fR),
this designates bracket-style comments; for example, "\fB/*|*/\fR" for
CSS files.  The characters before the pipe are prepended to the line and the
characters after the pipe are appended at the end of the line.  If no pipe
character is present, the full string is prepended; for example, "\fB#\fR"
for Python files.  If empty double quotes are specified, the comment/uncomment
function is disabled; for example, "" for JSON.
The default value is "\fB#\fP".
.TP
.BI "color " fgcolor , bgcolor " """ regex """ " \fR...
Display all pieces of text that match
the extended regular expression \fIregex\fP with foreground color
\fIfgcolor\fP and background color \fIbgcolor\fP, at least one of which
must be specified.  Valid names for foreground and background colors are:
.BR white ", " black ", " blue ", " green ", " red ", "
.BR cyan ", " yellow ", " magenta ", and " normal
-- where \fBnormal\fR means the default foreground or background color.
You may use the prefix \fBbright\fR to get a stronger color highlight for the
foreground.  If your terminal supports transparency, not specifying a
\fIbgcolor\fP tells \fBnano\fP to attempt to use a transparent
background.
.TP
.BI "icolor " fgcolor , bgcolor " """ regex """ " \fR...
Same as above, except that the matching is case insensitive.
.TP
.BI "color " fgcolor , bgcolor " start=""" fromrx """ end=""" torx """
Display all pieces of text whose start matches extended regular expression
\fIfromrx\fP and whose end matches extended regular expression \fItorx\fP with
foreground color \fIfgcolor\fP and background color \fIbgcolor\fP,
at least one of which must be specified.  This means that, after an
initial instance of \fIfromrx\fP, all text until the first instance of
\fItorx\fP will be colored.  This allows syntax highlighting to span
multiple lines.
.TP
.BI "icolor " fgcolor , bgcolor " start=""" fromrx """ end=""" torx """
Same as above, except that the matching is case insensitive.
.TP
.BI "include """ syntaxfile """
Read in self-contained color syntaxes from \fIsyntaxfile\fP.  Note that
\fIsyntaxfile\fP may contain only the above commands, from \fBsyntax\fP
to \fBicolor\fP.
.TP
.BI extendsyntax " name command " \fR[ "arg " \fR...]
Extend the syntax previously defined as \fIname\fR with another
\fIcommand\fR.  This allows adding a new \fBcolor\fP, \fBicolor\fP,
\fBheader\fP, \fBmagic\fP, \fBcomment\fP, or \fBlinter\fP
command to an already defined syntax -- useful when you want to
slightly improve a syntax defined in one of the system-installed
files (which normally are not writable).

.P
Note: the \fBformatter\fR command has been removed.  It was superseded by
a more general mechanism: the filtering of buffer or marked text through
an external command.  Such filtering is done by typing \fB^R^X\fR and then
preceding your formatter command with the pipe symbol (\fB|\fR).  It has
the added advantage that the operation can be undone.
.PP
If you use such a formatting command regularly, you could assign the relevant
series of keystrokes to a single key in your nanorc:
.PP
.RS
.B "bind  M\-F  \(dq^R^X|yourformatcommand^M\(dq  main"
.RE
.PP
(Note that the \fB^R\fR, \fB^X\fR, and \fB^M\fR are each a single, literal
control character.  You can enter them by preceding each with \fBM-V\fR.)

.SH REBINDING KEYS
Key bindings can be changed via the following three commands:
.RS 3
.TP
.BI bind " key function menu"
Rebinds the key \fIkey\fP to a new function named \fIfunction\fP in the
context of menu \fImenu\fP (or in all menus where the function exists
by using \fBall\fP).
.TP
.BI bind " key " """" string """" " menu"
Makes the given \fIkey\fR produce the given \fIstring\fR in the given
\fImenu\fR (or in all menus where the key exists when \fBall\fR is used).
The \fIstring\fR can consist of text or commands or a mix of them.
(To enter a command into the \fIstring\fR, precede its keystroke
with \fBM-V\fR.)

.TP
.BI unbind " key menu"
Unbinds the key \fIkey\fP from the menu named \fImenu\fP (or from all
menus where it exists by using \fBall\fP).
.RE

.TP
The format of \fIkey\fP should be one of:
.RS 3
.TP 3
.B ^
followed by a Latin letter, by one of several ASCII characters
(@, ], \\, ^, or _), or by the word "Space".
Example: ^C.
.TP
.B M-
followed by any ASCII character except [, or by the word "Space".
Example: M-C.
.TP
.B F
followed by a numeric value from 1 to 16.
Example: F10.
