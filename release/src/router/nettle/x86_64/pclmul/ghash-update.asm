C Use pclmulqdq, doing one 64x64 --> 127 bit carry-less multiplication,
C with source operands being selected from the halves of two 128-bit registers.
C Variants:
C  pclmullqlqdq low half of both src and destination
C  pclmulhqlqdq low half of src register, high half of dst register
C  pclmullqhqdq high half of src register, low half of dst register
C  pclmulhqhqdq high half of both src and destination

C To do a single block, M0, M1, we need to compute
C
C R = M0 D1 + M1 H1
C F = M0 D0 + M1 H0
C
C Corresponding to x^{-127} M H = R + x^{-64} F
C
C Split F as F = F1 + x^64 F0, then the final reduction is
C
C R + x^{-64} F = R + P1 F0 + x^{64} F0 + F1
C
C In all, 5 pclmulqdq. If we we have enough registers to interleave two blocks,
C final reduction is needed only once, so 9 pclmulqdq for two blocks, etc.
C
C We need one register each for D and H, one for P1, one each for accumulating F
C and R. That uses 5 out of the 16 available xmm registers. If we interleave
C blocks, we need additionan D ang H registers (for powers of the key) and the
C additional message word, but we could perhaps interlave as many as 4, with two
C registers left for temporaries.

	RODATA
	C The GCM polynomial is x^{128} + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1,
	C but in bit-reversed representation, that is
	C P = x^{128}+ x^{127} + x^{126} + x^{121} + 1
	C We will mainly use the middle part,
	C P1 = (P + a + x^{128}) / x^64 = x^{563} + x^{62} + x^{57}
