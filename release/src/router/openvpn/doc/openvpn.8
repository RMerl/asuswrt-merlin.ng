.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
OpenVPN is an open source VPN daemon by James Yonan. Because OpenVPN
tries to be a universal VPN tool offering a great deal of flexibility,
there are a lot of options on this manual page. If you\(aqre new to
OpenVPN, you might want to skip ahead to the examples section where you
will see how to construct simple VPNs on the command line without even
needing a configuration file.
.sp
Also note that there\(aqs more documentation and examples on the OpenVPN
web site: \fI\%https://openvpn.net/\fP
.sp
And if you would like to see a shorter version of this manual, see the
openvpn usage message which can be obtained by running \fBopenvpn\fP
without any parameters.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. OpenVPN supports
SSL/TLS security, ethernet bridging, TCP or UDP tunnel transport through
proxies or NAT, support for dynamic IP addresses and DHCP, scalability
to hundreds or thousands of users, and portability to most major OS
platforms.
.sp
OpenVPN is tightly bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much of its
crypto capabilities from it.
.sp
OpenVPN supports conventional encryption using a pre\-shared secret key
\fB(Static Key mode)\fP or public key security \fB(SSL/TLS mode)\fP using
client & server certificates. OpenVPN also supports non\-encrypted
TCP/UDP tunnels.
.sp
OpenVPN is designed to work with the \fBTUN/TAP\fP virtual networking
interface that exists on most platforms.
.sp
Overall, OpenVPN aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but
with a relatively lightweight footprint.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in
a configuration file. Though all command line options are preceded by a
double\-leading\-dash (\(dq\-\-\(dq), this prefix can be removed when an option is
placed in a configuration file.
.SS Generic Options
.sp
This section covers generic options which are accessible regardless of
which mode OpenVPN is configured as.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B  \-\-help
Show options.
.TP
.B  \-\-auth\-nocache
Don\(aqt cache \fB\-\-askpass\fP or \fB\-\-auth\-user\-pass\fP username/passwords in
virtual memory.
.sp
If specified, this directive will cause OpenVPN to immediately forget
username/password inputs after they are used. As a result, when OpenVPN
needs a username/password, it will prompt for input from stdin, which
may be multiple times during the duration of an OpenVPN session.
.sp
When using \fB\-\-auth\-nocache\fP in combination with a user/password file
and \fB\-\-chroot\fP or \fB\-\-daemon\fP, make sure to use an absolute path.
.sp
This directive does not affect the \fB\-\-http\-proxy\fP username/password.
It is always cached.
.TP
.BI \-\-cd \ dir
Change directory to \fBdir\fP prior to reading any files such as
configuration files, key files, scripts, etc. \fBdir\fP should be an
absolute path, with a leading \(dq/\(dq, and without any references to the
current directory such as \fB\&.\fP or \fB\&..\fP\&.
.sp
This option is useful when you are running OpenVPN in \fB\-\-daemon\fP mode,
and you want to consolidate all of your OpenVPN control files in one
location.
.TP
.BI \-\-chroot \ dir
Chroot to \fBdir\fP after initialization. \fB\-\-chroot\fP essentially
redefines \fBdir\fP as being the top level directory tree (/). OpenVPN
will therefore be unable to access any files outside this tree. This can
be desirable from a security standpoint.
.sp
Since the chroot operation is delayed until after initialization, most
OpenVPN options that reference files will operate in a pre\-chroot
context.
.sp
In many cases, the \fBdir\fP parameter can point to an empty directory,
however complications can result when scripts or restarts are executed
after the chroot operation.
.sp
Note: The SSL library will probably need /dev/urandom to be available
inside the chroot directory \fBdir\fP\&. This is because SSL libraries
occasionally need to collect fresh randomness. Newer linux kernels and some
BSDs implement a getrandom() or getentropy() syscall that removes the
need for /dev/urandom to be available.
.TP
.BI \-\-compat\-mode \ version
This option provides a convenient way to alter the defaults of OpenVPN
to be more compatible with the version \fBversion\fP specified. All of
the changes this option applies can also be achieved using individual
configuration options.
.sp
The version specified with this option is the version of OpenVPN peer
OpenVPN should try to be compatible with. In general OpenVPN should be
compatible with the last two previous version without this option. E.g.
OpenVPN 2.6.0 should be compatible with 2.5.x and 2.4.x without this option.
However, there might be some edge cases that still require this option even
in these cases.
.sp
Note: Using this option reverts defaults to no longer recommended
values and should be avoided if possible.
.sp
The following table details what defaults are changed depending on the
version specified.
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
2.5.x or lower: \fB\-\-allow\-compression asym\fP is automatically added
to the configuration if no other compression options are present.
.IP \(bu 2
2.4.x or lower: The cipher in \fB\-\-cipher\fP is appended to
\fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
2.3.x or lower: \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\-fallback\fP is automatically added with
the same cipher as \fB\-\-cipher\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
2.3.6 or lower: \fB\-\-tls\-version\-min 1.0\fP is added to the configuration
when \fB\-\-tls\-version\-min\fP is not explicitly set.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If not required, this is option should be avoided. Setting this option can
lower security or disable features like data\-channel offloading.
.TP
.BI \-\-config \ file
Load additional config options from \fBfile\fP where each line corresponds
to one command line option, but with the leading \fB\-\-\fP removed.
.sp
If \fB\-\-config file\fP is the only option to the openvpn command, the
\fB\-\-config\fP can be removed, and the command can be given as \fBopenvpn
file\fP
.sp
Note that configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.
.sp
Double quotation or single quotation characters (\(dq\(dq, \(aq\(aq) can be used to
enclose single parameters containing whitespace, and \(dq#\(dq or \(dq;\(dq
characters in the first column can be used to denote comments.
.sp
Note that OpenVPN 2.0 and higher performs backslash\-based shell escaping
for characters not in single quotations, so the following mappings
should be observed:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\e\e       Maps to a single backslash character (\e).
\e\(dq       Pass a literal doublequote character (\(dq), don\(aqt
         interpret it as enclosing a parameter.
\e[SPACE] Pass a literal space or tab character, don\(aqt
         interpret it as a parameter delimiter.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example on Windows, use double backslashes to represent pathnames:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
secret \(dqc:\e\eOpenVPN\e\esecret.key\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For examples of configuration files, see
\fI\%https://openvpn.net/community\-resources/how\-to/\fP
.sp
Here is an example configuration file:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#
# Sample OpenVPN configuration file for
# using a pre\-shared static key.
#
# \(aq#\(aq or \(aq;\(aq may be used to delimit comments.

# Use a dynamic tun device.

# 10.1.0.1 is our local VPN endpoint
# 10.1.0.2 is our remote VPN endpoint

# Our pre\-shared static key
secret static.key
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-daemon \ progname
Become a daemon after all initialization functions are completed.
.sp
Valid syntaxes:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
daemon
daemon progname
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This option will cause all message and error output to be sent to the syslog
file (such as \fB/var/log/messages\fP), except for the output of
scripts and ifconfig commands, which will go to \fB/dev/null\fP unless
otherwise redirected. The syslog redirection occurs immediately at the
point that \fB\-\-daemon\fP is parsed on the command line even though the
daemonization point occurs later. If one of the \fB\-\-log\fP options is
present, it will supersede syslog redirection.
.sp
The optional \fBprogname\fP parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its
program name to the system logger as \fBprogname\fP\&. This can be useful in
linking OpenVPN messages in the syslog file with specific tunnels. When
unspecified, \fBprogname\fP defaults to \fBopenvpn\fP\&.
.sp
When OpenVPN is run with the \fB\-\-daemon\fP option, it will try to delay
daemonization until the majority of initialization functions which are
capable of generating fatal errors are complete. This means that
initialization scripts can test the return status of the openvpn command
for a fairly reliable indication of whether the command has correctly
initialized and entered the packet forwarding event loop.
.sp
In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initialization
are non\-fatal.
.sp
Note: as soon as OpenVPN has daemonized, it can not ask for usernames,
passwords, or key pass phrases anymore. This has certain consequences,
namely that using a password\-protected private key will fail unless the
\fB\-\-askpass\fP option is used to tell OpenVPN to ask for the pass phrase
(this requirement is new in v2.3.7, and is a consequence of calling
daemon() before initializing the crypto layer).
.sp
Further, using \fB\-\-daemon\fP together with \fB\-\-auth\-user\-pass\fP (entered
on console) and \fB\-\-auth\-nocache\fP will fail as soon as key
renegotiation (and reauthentication) occurs.
.TP
.B  \-\-disable\-dco
Disable \(dqdata channel offload\(dq (DCO).
.sp
On Linux don\(aqt use the ovpn\-dco device driver, but rather rely on the
legacy tun module.
.sp
You may want to use this option if your server needs to allow clients
older than version 2.4 to connect.
.TP
.B  \-\-disable\-occ
\fBDEPRECATED\fP Disable \(dqoptions consistency check\(dq (OCC) in configurations
that do not use TLS.
.sp
Don\(aqt output a warning message if option inconsistencies are detected
between peers. An example of an option inconsistency would be where one
peer uses \fB\-\-dev tun\fP while the other peer uses \fB\-\-dev tap\fP\&.
.sp
Use of this option is discouraged, but is provided as a temporary fix in
situations where a recent version of OpenVPN must connect to an old
version.
.TP
.BI \-\-engine \ engine\-name
Enable OpenSSL hardware\-based crypto engine functionality.
.sp
Valid syntaxes:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
engine
engine engine\-name
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fBengine\-name\fP is specified, use a specific crypto engine. Use the
\fB\-\-show\-engines\fP standalone option to list the crypto engines which
are supported by OpenSSL.
.TP
.B  \-\-fast\-io
(Experimental) Optimize TUN/TAP/UDP I/O writes by avoiding a call to
poll/epoll/select prior to the write operation. The purpose of such a
call would normally be to block until the device or socket is ready to
accept the write. Such blocking is unnecessary on some platforms which
don\(aqt support write blocking on UDP sockets or TUN/TAP devices. In such
cases, one can optimize the event loop by avoiding the poll/epoll/select
call, improving CPU efficiency by 5% to 10%.
.sp
This option can only be used on non\-Windows systems, when \fB\-\-proto
udp\fP is specified, and when \fB\-\-shaper\fP is \fINOT\fP specified.
.TP
.BI \-\-group \ group
Similar to the \fB\-\-user\fP option, this option changes the group ID of
the OpenVPN process to \fBgroup\fP after initialization.
.TP
.BI \-\-ignore\-unknown\-option \ args
Valid syntax:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ignore\-unknown\-options opt1 opt2 opt3 ... optN
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When one of options \fBopt1 ... optN\fP is encountered in the configuration
file the configuration file parsing does not fail if this OpenVPN version
does not support the option. Multiple \fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\-option\fP options
can be given to support a larger number of options to ignore.
.sp
This option should be used with caution, as there are good security
reasons for having OpenVPN fail if it detects problems in a config file.
Having said that, there are valid reasons for wanting new software
features to gracefully degrade when encountered by older software
versions.
.sp
\fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\-option\fP is available since OpenVPN 2.3.3.
.TP
.BI \-\-iproute \ cmd
Set alternate command to execute instead of default \fBiproute2\fP command.
May be used in order to execute OpenVPN in unprivileged environment.
.TP
.BI \-\-keying\-material\-exporter \ args
Save Exported Keying Material [RFC5705] of \fBlen\fP bytes (must be between 16
and 4095 bytes) using \fBlabel\fP in environment
(\fBexported_keying_material\fP) for use by plugins in
\fBOPENVPN_PLUGIN_TLS_FINAL\fP callback.
.sp
Valid syntax:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
keying\-material\-exporter label len
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that exporter \fBlabels\fP have the potential to collide with existing
PRF labels. In order to prevent this, labels \fIMUST\fP begin with
\fBEXPORTER\fP\&.
.TP
.B  \-\-mlock
Disable paging by calling the POSIX mlockall function. Requires that
OpenVPN be initially run as root (though OpenVPN can subsequently
downgrade its UID using the \fB\-\-user\fP option).
.sp
Using this option ensures that key material and tunnel data are never
written to disk due to virtual memory paging operations which occur
under most modern operating systems. It ensures that even if an attacker
was able to crack the box running OpenVPN, he would not be able to scan
the system swap file to recover previously used ephemeral keys, which
are used for a period of time governed by the \fB\-\-reneg\fP options (see
below), then are discarded.
.sp
The downside of using \fB\-\-mlock\fP is that it will reduce the amount of
physical memory available to other applications.
.sp
The limit on how much memory can be locked and how that limit
is enforced are OS\-dependent. On Linux the default limit that an
unprivileged process may lock (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) is low, and if
privileges are dropped later, future memory allocations will very
likely fail. The limit can be increased using ulimit or systemd
directives depending on how OpenVPN is started.
.sp
If the platform has the getrlimit(2) system call, OpenVPN will check
for the amount of mlock\-able memory before calling mlockall(2), and
tries to increase the limit to 100 MB if less than this is configured.
100 Mb is somewhat arbitrary \- it is enough for a moderately\-sized
OpenVPN deployment, but the memory usage might go beyond that if the
number of concurrent clients is high.
.TP
.BI \-\-nice \ n
Change process priority after initialization (\fBn\fP greater than 0 is
lower priority, \fBn\fP less than zero is higher priority).
.TP
.B  \-\-persist\-key
Don\(aqt re\-read key files across \fBSIGUSR1\fP or \fB\-\-ping\-restart\fP\&.
.sp
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-user\fP to allow restarts
triggered by the \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal. Normally if you drop root
privileges in OpenVPN, the daemon cannot be restarted since it will now
be unable to re\-read protected key files.
.sp
This option solves the problem by persisting keys across \fBSIGUSR1\fP
resets, so they don\(aqt need to be re\-read.
.TP
.BI \-\-providers \ providers
Load the list of (OpenSSL) providers. This is mainly useful for using an
external provider for key management like tpm2\-openssl or to load the
legacy provider with
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-providers legacy default
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Behaviour of changing this option between \fBSIGHUP\fP might not be well behaving.
If you need to change/add/remove this option, fully restart OpenVPN.
.TP
.BI \-\-remap\-usr1 \ signal
Control whether internally or externally generated \fBSIGUSR1\fP signals
are remapped to \fBSIGHUP\fP (restart without persisting state) or
\fBSIGTERM\fP (exit).
.sp
\fBsignal\fP can be set to \fBSIGHUP\fP or \fBSIGTERM\fP\&. By default,
no remapping occurs.
.TP
.BI \-\-script\-security \ level
This directive offers policy\-level control over OpenVPN\(aqs usage of
external programs and scripts. Lower \fBlevel\fP values are more
restrictive, higher values are more permissive. Settings for \fBlevel\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB0\fP
Strictly no calling of external programs.
.TP
.B \fB1\fP
(Default) Only call built\-in executables such as ifconfig,
ip, route, or netsh.
.TP
.B \fB2\fP
Allow calling of built\-in executables and user\-defined
scripts.
.TP
.B \fB3\fP
Allow passwords to be passed to scripts via environmental
variables (potentially unsafe).
.UNINDENT
.sp
OpenVPN releases before v2.3 also supported a \fBmethod\fP flag which
indicated how OpenVPN should call external commands and scripts. This
could be either \fBexecve\fP or \fBsystem\fP\&. As of OpenVPN 2.3, this
flag is no longer accepted. In most *nix environments the execve()
approach has been used without any issues.
.sp
Some directives such as \fB\-\-up\fP allow options to be passed to the
external script. In these cases make sure the script name does not
contain any spaces or the configuration parser will choke because it
can\(aqt determine where the script name ends and script options start.
.sp
To run scripts in Windows in earlier OpenVPN versions you needed to
either add a full path to the script interpreter which can parse the
script or use the \fBsystem\fP flag to run these scripts. As of OpenVPN
2.3 it is now a strict requirement to have full path to the script
interpreter when running non\-executables files. This is not needed for
executable files, such as .exe, .com, .bat or .cmd files. For example,
if you have a Visual Basic script, you must use this syntax now:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-up \(aqC:\e\eWindows\e\eSystem32\e\ewscript.exe C:\e\eProgram\e Files\e\eOpenVPN\e\econfig\e\emy\-up\-script.vbs\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Please note the single quote marks and the escaping of the backslashes
(\e) and the space character.
.sp
The reason the support for the \fBsystem\fP flag was removed is due to
the security implications with shell expansions when executing scripts
via the \fBsystem()\fP call.
.TP
.BI \-\-setcon \ context
Apply SELinux \fBcontext\fP after initialization. This essentially
provides the ability to restrict OpenVPN\(aqs rights to only network I/O
operations, thanks to SELinux. This goes further than \fB\-\-user\fP and
\fB\-\-chroot\fP in that those two, while being great security features,
unfortunately do not protect against privilege escalation by
exploitation of a vulnerable system call. You can of course combine all
three, but please note that since setcon requires access to /proc you
will have to provide it inside the chroot directory (e.g. with mount
\-\-bind).
.sp
Since the setcon operation is delayed until after initialization,
OpenVPN can be restricted to just network\-related system calls, whereas
by applying the context before startup (such as the OpenVPN one provided
in the SELinux Reference Policies) you will have to allow many things
required only during initialization.
.sp
Like with chroot, complications can result when scripts or restarts are
executed after the setcon operation, which is why you should really
consider using the \fB\-\-persist\-key\fP and \fB\-\-persist\-tun\fP options.
.TP
.BI \-\-status \ args
Write operational status to \fBfile\fP every \fBn\fP seconds. \fBn\fP defaults
to \fB60\fP if not specified.
.sp
Valid syntaxes:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
status file
status file n
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Status can also be written to the syslog by sending a \fBSIGUSR2\fP
signal.
.sp
With multi\-client capability enabled on a server, the status file
includes a list of clients and a routing table. The output format can be
controlled by the \fB\-\-status\-version\fP option in that case.
.sp
For clients or instances running in point\-to\-point mode, it will contain
the traffic statistics.
.TP
.BI \-\-status\-version \ n
Set the status file format version number to \fBn\fP\&.
.sp
This only affects the status file on servers with multi\-client
capability enabled.  Valid status version values:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB1\fP
Traditional format (default). The client list contains the
following fields comma\-separated: Common Name, Real Address, Bytes
Received, Bytes Sent, Connected Since.
.TP
.B \fB2\fP
A more reliable format for external processing. Compared to
version \fB1\fP, the client list contains some additional fields:
Virtual Address, Virtual IPv6 Address, Username, Client ID, Peer ID,
Data Channel Cipher. Future versions may extend the number of fields.
.TP
.B \fB3\fP
Identical to \fB2\fP, but fields are tab\-separated.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B  \-\-test\-crypto
Do a self\-test of OpenVPN\(aqs crypto options by encrypting and decrypting
test packets using the data channel encryption options specified above.
This option does not require a peer to function, and therefore can be
specified without \fB\-\-dev\fP or \fB\-\-remote\fP\&.
.sp
The typical usage of \fB\-\-test\-crypto\fP would be something like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
openvpn \-\-test\-crypto \-\-secret key
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
openvpn \-\-test\-crypto \-\-secret key \-\-verb 9
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This option is very useful to test OpenVPN after it has been ported to a
new platform, or to isolate problems in the compiler, OpenSSL crypto
library, or OpenVPN\(aqs crypto code. Since it is a self\-test mode,
problems with encryption and authentication can be debugged
independently of network and tunnel issues.
.TP
.BI \-\-tmp\-dir \ dir
Specify a directory \fBdir\fP for temporary files. This directory will be
used by openvpn processes and script to communicate temporary data with
openvpn main process. Note that the directory must be writable by the
OpenVPN process after it has dropped it\(aqs root privileges.
.sp
This directory will be used by in the following cases:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-client\-connect\fP scripts and \fBOPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT\fP
plug\-in hook to dynamically generate client\-specific configuration
\fBclient_connect_config_file\fP and return success/failure via
\fBclient_connect_deferred_file\fP when using deferred client connect
method
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY\fP plug\-in hooks returns
success/failure via \fBauth_control_file\fP when using deferred auth
method and pending authentication via \fBpending_auth_file\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B  \-\-use\-prediction\-resistance
Enable prediction resistance on mbed TLS\(aqs RNG.
.sp
Enabling prediction resistance causes the RNG to reseed in each call for
random. Reseeding this often can quickly deplete the kernel entropy
pool.
.sp
If you need this option, please consider running a daemon that adds
entropy to the kernel pool.
.TP
.BI \-\-user \ user
Change the user ID of the OpenVPN process to \fBuser\fP after
initialization, dropping privileges in the process. This option is
useful to protect the system in the event that some hostile party was
able to gain control of an OpenVPN session. Though OpenVPN\(aqs security
features make this unlikely, it is provided as a second line of defense.
.sp
By setting \fBuser\fP to an unprivileged user dedicated to run openvpn,
the hostile party would be limited in what damage they could cause. Of
course once you take away privileges, you cannot return them to an
OpenVPN session. This means, for example, that if you want to reset an
OpenVPN daemon with a \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal (for example in response to
a DHCP reset), you should make use of one or more of the \fB\-\-persist\fP
options to ensure that OpenVPN doesn\(aqt need to execute any privileged
operations in order to restart (such as re\-reading key files or running
\fBifconfig\fP on the TUN device).
.sp
NOTE: Previous versions of openvpn used \fBnobody\fP as the example
unpriviledged user. It is not recommended to actually use that user
since it is usually used by other system services already. Always
create a dedicated user for openvpn.
.TP
.BI \-\-writepid \ file
Write OpenVPN\(aqs main process ID to \fBfile\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Log options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-echo \ parms
Echo \fBparms\fP to log output.
.sp
Designed to be used to send messages to a controlling application which
is receiving the OpenVPN log output.
.TP
.B  \-\-errors\-to\-stderr
Output errors to stderr instead of stdout unless log output is
redirected by one of the \fB\-\-log\fP options.
.TP
.BI \-\-log \ file
Output logging messages to \fBfile\fP, including output to stdout/stderr
which is generated by called scripts. If \fBfile\fP already exists it will
be truncated. This option takes effect immediately when it is parsed in
the command line and will supersede syslog output if \fB\-\-daemon\fP

.TP
.BI \-\-auth \ alg
Authenticate data channel packets and (if enabled) \fBtls\-auth\fP control
channel packets with HMAC using message digest algorithm \fBalg\fP\&. (The
default is \fBSHA1\fP ). HMAC is a commonly used message authentication
algorithm (MAC) that uses a data string, a secure hash algorithm and a
key to produce a digital signature.
.sp
The OpenVPN data channel protocol uses encrypt\-then\-mac (i.e. first
encrypt a packet then HMAC the resulting ciphertext), which prevents
padding oracle attacks.
.sp
If an AEAD cipher mode (e.g. GCM) is chosen then the specified \fB\-\-auth\fP
algorithm is ignored for the data channel and the authentication method
of the AEAD cipher is used instead. Note that \fBalg\fP still specifies
the digest used for \fBtls\-auth\fP\&.
.sp
In static\-key encryption mode, the HMAC key is included in the key file
generated by \fB\-\-genkey\fP\&. In TLS mode, the HMAC key is dynamically
generated and shared between peers via the TLS control channel. If
OpenVPN receives a packet with a bad HMAC it will drop the packet. HMAC
usually adds 16 or 20 bytes per packet. Set \fBalg=none\fP to disable
authentication.
.sp

.IP \(bu 2
allow users connecting to OpenVPN peers older than 2.6.0
to have \fB\-\-cipher\fP configured the same way as the remote

.UNINDENT
.sp
Before 2.4.0, this option was used to select the cipher to be
configured on the data channel, however, later versions usually
ignored this directive in favour of a negotiated cipher.
Starting with 2.6.0, this option is always ignored in TLS mode
when it comes to configuring the cipher and will only control the
cipher for \fB\-\-secret\fP pre\-shared\-key mode (note: this mode is
deprecated and strictly not recommended).
.sp
If you wish to specify the cipher to use on the data channel,
please see \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP (for regular negotiation) and
\fB\-\-data\-ciphers\-fallback\fP (for a fallback option when the
negotiation cannot take place because the other peer is old or
has negotiation disabled).
.sp

\fB\-\-show\-ciphers\fP option.
.sp
Set \fBalg\fP to \fBnone\fP to disable encryption.
.TP
.BI \-\-compress \ algorithm
\fBDEPRECATED\fP Enable a compression algorithm. Compression is generally
not recommended. VPN tunnels which use compression are susceptible to
the VORALCE attack vector. See also the \fBmigrate\fP parameter below.
.sp
The \fBalgorithm\fP parameter may be \fBlzo\fP, \fBlz4\fP,
\fBlz4\-v2\fP, \fBstub\fP, \fBstub\-v2\fP, \fBmigrate\fP or empty.
LZO and LZ4 are different compression algorithms, with LZ4 generally
offering the best performance with least CPU usage.
.sp
The \fBlz4\-v2\fP and \fBstub\-v2\fP variants implement a better
framing that does not add overhead when packets cannot be compressed. All
other variants always add one extra framing byte compared to no
compression framing.
.sp
Especially \fBstub\-v2\fP is essentially identical to no compression and
no compression framing as its header indicates IP version 5 in a tun setup
and can (ab)used to complete disable compression to clients. (See the
\fBmigrate\fP option below)
.sp
If the \fBalgorithm\fP parameter is \fBstub\fP, \fBstub\-v2\fP or empty,
compression will be turned off, but the packet framing for compression
will still be enabled, allowing a different setting to be pushed later.
Additionally, \fBstub\fP and \fBstub\-v2\fP wil disable announcing
\fBlzo\fP and \fBlz4\fP compression support via \fIIV_\fP variables to the
server.
.sp
Note: the \fBstub\fP (or empty) option is NOT compatible with the older
option \fB\-\-comp\-lzo no\fP\&.
.sp
Using \fBmigrate\fP as compression algorithm enables a special migration mode.
It allows migration away from the \fB\-\-compress\fP/\fB\-\-comp\-lzo\fP options to no compression.
This option sets the server to no compression mode and the server behaves identical to
a server without a compression option for all clients without a compression in their
config. However, if a client is detected that indicates that compression is used (via OCC),
the server will automatically add \fB\-\-push compress stub\-v2\fP to the client specific
configuration if supported by the client and otherwise switch to \fBcomp\-lzo no\fP
and add \fB\-\-push comp\-lzo\fP to the client specific configuration.
.sp
\fB*Security Considerations*\fP
.sp
Compression and encryption is a tricky combination. If an attacker knows
or is able to control (parts of) the plain\-text of packets that contain
secrets, the attacker might be able to extract the secret if compression
is enabled. See e.g. the \fICRIME\fP and \fIBREACH\fP attacks on TLS and
\fIVORACLE\fP on VPNs which also leverage to break encryption. If you are not
entirely sure that the above does not apply to your traffic, you are
advised to \fInot\fP enable compression.
.TP
.BI \-\-comp\-lzo \ mode
\fBDEPRECATED\fP Enable LZO compression algorithm.  Compression is
generally not recommended.  VPN tunnels which uses compression are
suspectible to the VORALCE attack vector.
.sp
Use LZO compression \-\- may add up to 1 byte per packet for incompressible
data. \fBmode\fP may be \fByes\fP, \fBno\fP, or \fBadaptive\fP
(default).
.sp
In a server mode setup, it is possible to selectively turn compression
on or off for individual clients.
.sp
First, make sure the client\-side config file enables selective
compression by having at least one \fB\-\-comp\-lzo\fP directive, such as
\fB\-\-comp\-lzo no\fP\&. This will turn off compression by default, but allow
a future directive push from the server to dynamically change the
\fBon\fP/\fBoff\fP/\fBadaptive\fP setting.
.sp
Next in a \fB\-\-client\-config\-dir\fP file, specify the compression setting
for the client, for example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
comp\-lzo yes
push \(dqcomp\-lzo yes\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first line sets the \fBcomp\-lzo\fP setting for the server side of the
link, the second sets the client side.
.TP
.B  \-\-comp\-noadapt
\fBDEPRECATED\fP When used in conjunction with \fB\-\-comp\-lzo\fP, this option
will disable OpenVPN\(aqs adaptive compression algorithm. Normally, adaptive
compression is enabled with \fB\-\-comp\-lzo\fP\&.
.sp
Adaptive compression tries to optimize the case where you have
compression enabled, but you are sending predominantly incompressible
(or pre\-compressed) packets over the tunnel, such as an FTP or rsync
transfer of a large, compressed file. With adaptive compression, OpenVPN
will periodically sample the compression process to measure its
efficiency. If the data being sent over the tunnel is already
compressed, the compression efficiency will be very low, triggering
openvpn to disable compression for a period of time until the next
re\-sample test.
.TP
.B  \-\-key\-direction
Alternative way of specifying the optional direction parameter for the
\fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP and \fB\-\-secret\fP options. Useful when using inline files
(See section on inline files).
.TP
.BI \-\-data\-ciphers \ cipher\-list
Restrict the allowed ciphers to be negotiated to the ciphers in
\fBcipher\-list\fP\&. \fBcipher\-list\fP is a colon\-separated list of ciphers,
and defaults to \fBAES\-256\-GCM:AES\-128\-GCM:CHACHA20\-POLY1305\fP when
Chacha20\-Poly1305 is available and otherwise \fBAES\-256\-GCM:AES\-128\-GCM\fP\&.
.sp
For servers, the first cipher from \fBcipher\-list\fP that is also
supported by the client will be pushed to clients that support cipher
negotiation.
.sp
For more details see the chapter on \fI\%Data channel cipher negotiation\fP\&.
\fIEspecially\fP if you need to support clients with OpenVPN versions older
than 2.4!
.sp
Starting with OpenVPN 2.6 a cipher can be prefixed with a \fB?\fP to mark
it as optional. This allows including ciphers in the list that may not be
available on all platforms.
E.g. \fBAES\-256\-GCM:AES\-128\-GCM:?CHACHA20\-POLY1305\fP would only enable
Chacha20\-Poly1305 if the underlying SSL library (and its configuration)
supports it.
.sp
Cipher negotiation is enabled in client\-server mode only. I.e. if
\fB\-\-mode\fP is set to \fIserver\fP (server\-side, implied by setting
\fB\-\-server\fP ), or if \fB\-\-pull\fP is specified (client\-side, implied by
setting \fB\-\-client\fP).
.sp
If no common cipher is found during cipher negotiation, the connection
is terminated. To support old clients/old servers that do not provide any
cipher negotiation support see \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\-fallback\fP\&.
.sp
If \fB\-\-compat\-mode\fP is set to a version older than 2.5.0 the cipher
specified by \fB\-\-cipher\fP will be appended to \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP if
not already present.
.sp
This list is restricted to be 127 chars long after conversion to OpenVPN
ciphers.
.sp
This option was called \fB\-\-ncp\-ciphers\fP in OpenVPN 2.4 but has been renamed
to \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP in OpenVPN 2.5 to more accurately reflect its meaning.
.TP
.BI \-\-data\-ciphers\-fallback \ alg
Configure a cipher that is used to fall back to if we could not determine
which cipher the peer is willing to use.

connect to peers that are running OpenVPN 2.3 or older versions, and
have been configured with \fB\-\-enable\-small\fP
(typically used on routers or other embedded devices).
.TP
.BI \-\-secret \ args

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional \fBdirection\fP parameter enables the use of 4 distinct keys
(HMAC\-send, cipher\-encrypt, HMAC\-receive, cipher\-decrypt), so that each
data flow direction has a different set of HMAC and cipher keys. This
has a number of desirable security properties including eliminating
certain kinds of DoS and message replay attacks.
.sp
When the \fBdirection\fP parameter is omitted, 2 keys are used
bidirectionally, one for HMAC and the other for encryption/decryption.
.sp
The \fBdirection\fP parameter should always be complementary on either
side of the connection, i.e. one side should use \fB0\fP and the other
should use \fB1\fP, or both sides should omit it altogether.
.sp
The \fBdirection\fP parameter requires that \fBfile\fP contains a 2048 bit
key. While pre\-1.5 versions of OpenVPN generate 1024 bit key files, any
version of OpenVPN which supports the \fBdirection\fP parameter, will also
support 2048 bit key file generation using the \fB\-\-genkey\fP option.
.sp
Static key encryption mode has certain advantages, the primary being
ease of configuration.
.sp
There are no certificates or certificate authorities or complicated
negotiation handshakes and protocols. The only requirement is that you
have a pre\-existing secure channel with your peer (such as \fBssh\fP) to
initially copy the key. This requirement, along with the fact that your
key never changes unless you manually generate a new one, makes it
somewhat less secure than TLS mode (see below). If an attacker manages
to steal your key, everything that was ever encrypted with it is
compromised. Contrast that to the perfect forward secrecy features of
TLS mode (using Diffie Hellman key exchange), where even if an attacker
was able to steal your private key, he would gain no information to help
him decrypt past sessions.
.sp
Another advantageous aspect of Static Key encryption mode is that it is
a handshake\-free protocol without any distinguishing signature or
feature (such as a header or protocol handshake sequence) that would
mark the ciphertext packets as being generated by OpenVPN. Anyone
eavesdropping on the wire would see nothing but random\-looking data.
.TP
.BI \-\-tran\-window \ n
Transition window \-\- our old key can live this many seconds after a new
a key renegotiation begins (default \fB3600\fP seconds). This feature
allows for a graceful transition from old to new key, and removes the key
renegotiation sequence from the critical path of tunnel data forwarding.
.TP
.B  \-\-force\-tls\-key\-material\-export
This option is only available in \-\-mode server and forces to use
Keying Material Exporters (RFC 5705) for clients. This can be used to
simulate an environment where the cryptographic library does not support
the older method to generate data channel keys anymore. This option is
intended to be a test option and might be removed in a future OpenVPN
version without notice.

.SS Client Options

.TP
.B  \-\-allow\-recursive\-routing
When this option is set, OpenVPN will not drop incoming tun packets with
same destination as host.
.TP
.BI \-\-auth\-token \ token
This is not an option to be used directly in any configuration files,
but rather push this option from a \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script or a
\fB\-\-plugin\fP which hooks into the \fBOPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT\fP
or \fBOPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT_V2\fP calls. This option provides a
possibility to replace the clients password with an authentication token
during the lifetime of the OpenVPN client.
.sp
Whenever the connection is renegotiated and the
\fB\-\-auth\-user\-pass\-verify\fP script or \fB\-\-plugin\fP making use of the
\fBOPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY\fP hook is triggered, it will
pass over this token as the password instead of the password the user
provided. The authentication token can only be reset by a full reconnect
where the server can push new options to the client. The password the
user entered is never preserved once an authentication token has been
set. If the OpenVPN server side rejects the authentication token then
the client will receive an \fBAUTH_FAILED\fP and disconnect.
.sp
The purpose of this is to enable two factor authentication methods, such
as HOTP or TOTP, to be used without needing to retrieve a new OTP code
each time the connection is renegotiated. Another use case is to cache
authentication data on the client without needing to have the users
password cached in memory during the life time of the session.
.sp
To make use of this feature, the \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script or
\fB\-\-plugin\fP needs to put

the OpenVPN server to push this value to the client, which replaces the
local password with the \fBUNIQUE_TOKEN_VALUE\fP\&.

Newer clients (2.4.7+) will fall back to the original password method
after a failed auth. Older clients will keep using the token value and
react according to \fB\-\-auth\-retry\fP

The \fB\-\-dns search\-domains\fP directive takes one or more domain names
to be added as DNS domain suffixes. If it is repeated multiple times within
a configuration the domains are appended, thus e.g. domain names pushed by
a server will amend locally defined ones.
.sp
The \fB\-\-dns server\fP directive is used to configure DNS server \fBn\fP\&.
The server id \fBn\fP must be a value between \-128 and 127. For pushed
DNS server options it must be between 0 and 127. The server id is used
to group options and also for ordering the list of configured DNS servers;
lower numbers come first. DNS servers being pushed to a client replace
already configured DNS servers with the same server id.
.sp
The \fBaddress\fP option configures the IPv4 and / or IPv6 address(es) of
the DNS server. Up to eight addresses can be specified per DNS server.
Optionally a port can be appended after a colon. IPv6 addresses need to
be enclosed in brackets if a port is appended.

Also, if you use multiple \fB\-\-remote\fP options, AND you are dropping
root privileges on the client with \fB\-\-user\fP and/or \fB\-\-group\fP AND
the client is running a non\-Windows OS, if the client needs to switch

close and reopen the TUN/TAP interface. This could cause the client
to exit with a fatal error.

If \fB\-\-remote\fP is unspecified, OpenVPN will listen for packets from any
IP address, but will not act on those packets unless they pass all
authentication tests. This requirement for authentication is binding on
all potential peers, even those from known and supposedly trusted IP
addresses (it is very easy to forge a source IP address on a UDP
packet).
.sp
When used in TCP mode, \fB\-\-remote\fP will act as a filter, rejecting
connections from any host which does not match \fBhost\fP\&.
.sp
If \fBhost\fP is a DNS name which resolves to multiple IP addresses,
OpenVPN will try them in the order that the system getaddrinfo()
presents them, so priorization and DNS randomization is done by the
system library. Unless an IP version is forced by the protocol
specification (4/6 suffix), OpenVPN will try both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, in the order getaddrinfo() returns them.

HTTP Digest authentication is supported as well, but only via the

.SS Server Options
.sp
Starting with OpenVPN 2.0, a multi\-client TCP/UDP server mode is
supported, and can be enabled with the \fB\-\-mode server\fP option. In
server mode, OpenVPN will listen on a single port for incoming client
connections. All client connections will be routed through a single tun
or tap interface. This mode is designed for scalability and should be
able to support hundreds or even thousands of clients on sufficiently
fast hardware. SSL/TLS authentication must be used in this mode.

.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After successful user/password authentication, the OpenVPN server will
with this option generate a temporary authentication token and push that
to the client. On the following renegotiations, the OpenVPN client will pass
this token instead of the users password. On the server side the server
will do the token authentication internally and it will NOT do any
additional authentications against configured external user/password
authentication mechanisms.
.sp
The tokens implemented by this mechanism include an initial timestamp and
a renew timestamp and are secured by HMAC.
.sp
The \fBlifetime\fP argument defines how long the generated token is valid.
The lifetime is defined in seconds. If lifetime is not set or it is set
to \fB0\fP, the token will never expire.
.sp
If \fBrenewal\-time\fP is not set it defaults to \fBreneg\-sec\fP\&.
.sp
The token will expire either after the configured \fBlifetime\fP of the
token is reached or after not being renewed for more than 2 *
\fBrenewal\-time\fP seconds. Clients will be sent renewed tokens on every TLS
renegotiation. If \fBrenewal\-time\fP is lower than \fBreneg\-sec\fP the server
will push an  updated temporary authentication token every \fBreneweal\-time\fP
seconds. This is done to invalidate a token if a client is disconnected for a
sufficiently long time, while at the same time permitting much longer token
lifetimes for active clients.
.sp
This feature is useful for environments which are configured to use One
Time Passwords (OTP) as part of the user/password authentications and
that authentication mechanism does not implement any auth\-token support.
.sp
When the \fBexternal\-auth\fP keyword is present the normal
authentication method will always be called even if auth\-token succeeds.
Normally other authentications method are skipped if auth\-token
verification succeeds or fails.
.sp
This option postpones this decision to the external authentication
methods and checks the validity of the account and do other checks.
.sp
In this mode the environment will have a \fBsession_id\fP variable that
holds the session id from auth\-gen\-token. Also an environment variable
\fBsession_state\fP is present. This variable indicates whether the
auth\-token has succeeded or not. It can have the following values:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBInitial\fP
No token from client.
.TP
.B \fBAuthenticated\fP
Token is valid and not expired.
.TP
.B \fBExpired\fP
Token is valid but has expired.
.TP
.B \fBInvalid\fP
Token is invalid (failed HMAC or wrong length)
.TP
.B \fBAuthenticatedEmptyUser\fP / \fBExpiredEmptyUser\fP
The token is not valid with the username sent from the client but
would be valid (or expired) if we assume an empty username was
used instead.  These two cases are a workaround for behaviour in
OpenVPN 3.  If this workaround is not needed these two cases should
be handled in the same way as \fBInvalid\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Use this feature only if you want your authentication
method called on every verification. Since the external authentication
is called it needs to also indicate a success or failure of the
authentication. It is strongly recommended to return an authentication
failure in the case of the Invalid/Expired auth\-token with the
external\-auth option unless the client could authenticate in another
acceptable way (e.g. client certificate), otherwise returning success
will lead to authentication bypass (as does returning success on a wrong
password from a script).
.TP
.BI \-\-auth\-gen\-token\-secret \ file
Specifies a file that holds a secret for the HMAC used in
\fB\-\-auth\-gen\-token\fP If \fBfile\fP is not present OpenVPN will generate a
random secret on startup. This file should be used if auth\-token should
validate after restarting a server or if client should be able to roam
between multiple OpenVPN servers with their auth\-token.
.TP
.B  \-\-auth\-user\-pass\-optional
Allow connections by clients that do not specify a username/password.
Normally, when \fB\-\-auth\-user\-pass\-verify\fP or
\fB\-\-management\-client\-auth\fP are specified (or an authentication plugin
module), the OpenVPN server daemon will require connecting clients to
specify a username and password. This option makes the submission of a
username/password by clients optional, passing the responsibility to the
user\-defined authentication module/script to accept or deny the client
based on other factors (such as the setting of X509 certificate fields).
When this option is used, and a connecting client does not submit a
username/password, the user\-defined authentication module/script will
see the username and password as being set to empty strings (\(dq\(dq). The
authentication module/script MUST have logic to detect this condition
and respond accordingly.
.TP
.B  \-\-ccd\-exclusive
Require, as a condition of authentication, that a connecting client has
a \fB\-\-client\-config\-dir\fP file.
.TP
.BI \-\-client\-config\-dir \ dir
Specify a directory \fBdir\fP for custom client config files. After a
connecting client has been authenticated, OpenVPN will look in this
directory for a file having the same name as the client\(aqs X509 common
name. If a matching file exists, it will be opened and parsed for
client\-specific configuration options. If no matching file is found,
OpenVPN will instead try to open and parse a default file called
\(dqDEFAULT\(dq, which may be provided but is not required. Note that the
configuration files must be readable by the OpenVPN process after it has
dropped it\(aqs root privileges.
.sp
This file can specify a fixed IP address for a given client using
\fB\-\-ifconfig\-push\fP, as well as fixed subnets owned by the client using
\fB\-\-iroute\fP\&.
.sp
One of the useful properties of this option is that it allows client
configuration files to be conveniently created, edited, or removed while
the server is live, without needing to restart the server.
.sp
The following options are legal in a client\-specific context: \fB\-\-push\fP,
\fB\-\-push\-reset\fP, \fB\-\-push\-remove\fP, \fB\-\-iroute\fP, \fB\-\-ifconfig\-push\fP,
\fB\-\-vlan\-pvid\fP and \fB\-\-config\fP\&.
.TP
.B  \-\-client\-to\-client
Because the OpenVPN server mode handles multiple clients through a
single tun or tap interface, it is effectively a router. The
\fB\-\-client\-to\-client\fP flag tells OpenVPN to internally route
client\-to\-client traffic rather than pushing all client\-originating
traffic to the TUN/TAP interface.
.sp
When this option is used, each client will \(dqsee\(dq the other clients which
are currently connected. Otherwise, each client will only see the
server. Don\(aqt use this option if you want to firewall tunnel traffic
using custom, per\-client rules.
.sp
Please note that when using data channel offload this option has no
effect. Packets are always sent to the tunnel interface and then
routed based on the system routing table.
.TP
.B  \-\-disable
Disable a particular client (based on the common name) from connecting.
Don\(aqt use this option to disable a client due to key or password
compromise. Use a CRL (certificate revocation list) instead (see the
\fB\-\-crl\-verify\fP option).
.sp
This option must be associated with a specific client instance, which

This directive can be used to route a fixed subnet from the server to a
particular client, regardless of where the client is connecting from.
Remember that you must also add the route to the system routing table as
well (such as by using the \fB\-\-route\fP directive). The reason why two
routes are needed is that the \fB\-\-route\fP directive routes the packet
from the kernel to OpenVPN. Once in OpenVPN, the \fB\-\-iroute\fP directive
routes to the specific client.
.sp
However, when using DCO, the \fB\-\-iroute\fP directive is usually enough
for DCO to fully configure the routing table. The extra \fB\-\-route\fP
directive is required only if the expected behaviour is to route the
traffic for a specific network to the VPN interface also when the
responsible client is not connected (traffic will then be dropped).
.sp
This option must be specified either in a client instance config file
using \fB\-\-client\-config\-dir\fP or dynamically generated using a
\fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script.
.sp
The \fB\-\-iroute\fP directive also has an important interaction with
\fB\-\-push \(dqroute ...\(dq\fP\&. \fB\-\-iroute\fP essentially defines a subnet which
is owned by a particular client (we will call this client \fIA\fP). If you
would like other clients to be able to reach \fIA\fP\(aqs subnet, you can use
\fB\-\-push \(dqroute ...\(dq\fP together with \fB\-\-client\-to\-client\fP to effect
this. In order for all clients to see \fIA\fP\(aqs subnet, OpenVPN must push
this route to all clients EXCEPT for \fIA\fP, since the subnet is already
owned by \fIA\fP\&. OpenVPN accomplishes this by not not pushing a route to
a client if it matches one of the client\(aqs iroutes.

To configure ethernet bridging, you must first use your OS\(aqs bridging

For example, on Linux this is done with the \fBbrctl\fP tool, and with

meaning that the renegotiation will still occur once per \fB3600\fP

disable), and to your chosen value on the other side.

.SS TLS Mode Options
.sp
TLS mode is the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both security
and flexibility. TLS mode works by establishing control and data
channels which are multiplexed over a single TCP/UDP port. OpenVPN
initiates a TLS session over the control channel and uses it to exchange
cipher and HMAC keys to protect the data channel. TLS mode uses a robust
reliability layer over the UDP connection for all control channel
communication, while the data channel, over which encrypted tunnel data
passes, is forwarded without any mediation. The result is the best of
both worlds: a fast data channel that forwards over UDP with only the
overhead of encrypt, decrypt, and HMAC functions, and a control channel
that provides all of the security features of TLS, including
certificate\-based authentication and Diffie Hellman forward secrecy.
.sp
To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local
certificate/key pair (\fB\-\-cert\fP and \fB\-\-key\fP), signed by the root
certificate which is specified in \fB\-\-ca\fP\&.
.sp
When two OpenVPN peers connect, each presents its local certificate to
the other. Each peer will then check that its partner peer presented a
certificate which was signed by the master root certificate as specified
in \fB\-\-ca\fP\&.
.sp
If that check on both peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation will
succeed, both OpenVPN peers will exchange temporary session keys, and
the tunnel will begin passing data.

certificate authority (see above) or pay money to use a commercial
service such as thawte.com (in which case you will be helping to finance

In a nutshell, \fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP enables a kind of \(dqHMAC firewall\(dq on
OpenVPN\(aqs TCP/UDP port, where TLS control channel packets bearing an
incorrect HMAC signature can be dropped immediately without response.
.sp
\fBfile\fP (required) is a file in OpenVPN static key format which can be
generated by \fB\-\-genkey\fP\&.
.sp
Older versions (up to OpenVPN 2.3) supported a freeform passphrase file.
This is no longer supported in newer versions (v2.4+).
.sp
See the \fB\-\-secret\fP option for more information on the optional
\fBdirection\fP parameter.
.sp
\fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP is recommended when you are running OpenVPN in a mode
where it is listening for packets from any IP address, such as when
\fB\-\-remote\fP is not specified, or \fB\-\-remote\fP is specified with
\fB\-\-float\fP\&.
.sp
The rationale for this feature is as follows. TLS requires a
multi\-packet exchange before it is able to authenticate a peer. During
this time before authentication, OpenVPN is allocating resources (memory
and CPU) to this potential peer. The potential peer is also exposing
many parts of OpenVPN and the OpenSSL library to the packets it is
sending. Most successful network attacks today seek to either exploit
bugs in programs (such as buffer overflow attacks) or force a program to
consume so many resources that it becomes unusable. Of course the first
line of defense is always to produce clean, well\-audited code. OpenVPN
has been written with buffer overflow attack prevention as a top
priority. But as history has shown, many of the most widely used network
applications have, from time to time, fallen to buffer overflow attacks.
.sp
So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of
authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that every packet on
the control channel is authenticated by an HMAC signature and a unique
ID for replay protection. This signature will also help protect against
DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. An important rule of thumb in reducing
vulnerability to DoS attacks is to minimize the amount of resources a
potential, but as yet unauthenticated, client is able to consume.
.sp
\fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP does this by signing every TLS control channel packet
with an HMAC signature, including packets which are sent before the TLS
level has had a chance to authenticate the peer. The result is that
packets without the correct signature can be dropped immediately upon
reception, before they have a chance to consume additional system
resources such as by initiating a TLS handshake. \fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP can be
strengthened by adding the \fB\-\-replay\-persist\fP option which will keep
OpenVPN\(aqs replay protection state in a file so that it is not lost
across restarts.
.sp
It should be emphasized that this feature is optional and that the key
file used with \fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP gives a peer nothing more than the power
to initiate a TLS handshake. It is not used to encrypt or authenticate
any tunnel data.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-tls\-crypt\fP instead if you want to use the key file to not only

In contrast to \fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP, \fB\-\-tls\-crypt\fP does \fInot\fP require the

.sp
\fBSecurity Considerations\fP
.sp
All peers use the same \fB\-\-tls\-crypt\fP pre\-shared group key to
authenticate and encrypt control channel messages. To ensure that IV
collisions remain unlikely, this key should not be used to encrypt more
than 2^48 client\-to\-server or 2^48 server\-to\-client control channel
messages. A typical initial negotiation is about 10 packets in each
direction. Assuming both initial negotiation and renegotiations are at
most 2^16 (65536) packets (to be conservative), and (re)negotiations
happen each minute for each user (24/7), this limits the tls\-crypt key
lifetime to 8171 years divided by the number of users. So a setup with
1000 users should rotate the key at least once each eight years. (And a
setup with 8000 users each year.)
.sp
If IV collisions were to occur, this could result in the security of
\fB\-\-tls\-crypt\fP degrading to the same security as using \fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP\&.
That is, the control channel still benefits from the extra protection
against active man\-in\-the\-middle\-attacks and DoS attacks, but may no
longer offer extra privacy and post\-quantum security on top of what TLS
itself offers.
.sp
For large setups or setups where clients are not trusted, consider using
\fB\-\-tls\-crypt\-v2\fP instead. That uses per\-client unique keys, and
thereby improves the bounds to \(aqrotate a client key at least once per
8000 years\(aq.

For clients, \fBkeyfile\fP is a client\-specific tls\-crypt key. Such a key
can be generated using the \fB\-\-genkey tls\-crypt\-v2\-client\fP option.
.sp
For servers, \fBkeyfile\fP is used to unwrap client\-specific keys supplied
by the client during connection setup. This key must be the same as the
key used to generate the client\-specific key (see \fB\-\-genkey
tls\-crypt\-v2\-client\fP).
.sp
On servers, this option can be used together with the \fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP or
\fB\-\-tls\-crypt\fP option. In that case, the server will detect whether the
client is using client\-specific keys, and automatically select the right
mode.
.sp
The optional parameters \fBforce\-cookie\fP allows only tls\-crypt\-v2
clients that support a cookie based stateless three way handshake that
avoids replay attacks and state exhaustion on the server side (OpenVPN

When both client and server are at least running OpenVPN 2.5, that the order of

That means that the first cipher in that list that is also in the client\(aqs

.UNINDENT

OpenVPN 2.5 and later will only allow the ciphers specified in \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP\&.
If \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP is not set the default is \fBAES\-256\-GCM:AES\-128\-GCM\fP\&.
In 2.6 and later the default is changed to
\fBAES\-256\-GCM:AES\-128\-GCM:CHACHA20\-POLY1305\fP when Chacha20\-Poly1305 is available.
.sp
For backwards compatibility OpenVPN 2.6 and later with \fB\-\-compat\-mode 2.4.x\fP

\fB\-\-cipher\fP option to this list.
.SS OpenVPN 2.4 clients
.sp
The negotiation support in OpenVPN 2.4 was the first iteration of the implementation
and still had some quirks. Its main goal was \(dqupgrade to AES\-256\-GCM when possible\(dq.
An OpenVPN 2.4 client that is built against a crypto library that supports AES in GCM
mode and does not have \fB\-\-ncp\-disable\fP will always announce support for
\fIAES\-256\-GCM\fP and \fIAES\-128\-GCM\fP to a server by sending \fBIV_NCP=2\fP\&.

This only causes a problem if \fB\-\-ncp\-ciphers\fP option has been changed from the
default of \fBAES\-256\-GCM:AES\-128\-GCM\fP to a value that does not include
these two ciphers. When an OpenVPN server tries to use \fIAES\-256\-GCM\fP or
\fIAES\-128\-GCM\fP the connection will then fail. It is therefore recommended to
always have the \fIAES\-256\-GCM\fP and \fIAES\-128\-GCM\fP ciphers to the \fB\-\-ncp\-ciphers\fP
options to avoid this behaviour.
.SS OpenVPN 3 clients
.sp
Clients based on the OpenVPN 3.x library (\fI\%https://github.com/openvpn/openvpn3/\fP)
do not have a configurable \fB\-\-ncp\-ciphers\fP or \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP option. Newer
versions by default disable legacy AES\-CBC, BF\-CBC, and DES\-CBC ciphers.
These clients will always announce support for all their supported AEAD ciphers
(\fIAES\-256\-GCM\fP, \fIAES\-128\-GCM\fP and in newer versions also \fIChacha20\-Poly1305\fP).
.sp
To support OpenVPN 3.x based clients at least one of these ciphers needs to be
included in the server\(aqs \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP option.
.SS OpenVPN 2.3 and older clients (and clients with \fB\-\-ncp\-disable\fP)
.sp
When a client without cipher negotiation support connects to a server the
cipher specified with the \fB\-\-cipher\fP option in the client configuration
must be included in the \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP option of the server to allow
the client to connect. Otherwise the client will be sent the \fBAUTH_FAILED\fP
message that indicates no shared cipher.
.sp
If the client is 2.3 or older and has been configured with the
\fB\-\-enable\-small\fP  \fB\&./configure\fP argument, using
\fBdata\-ciphers\-fallback cipher\fP in the server config file with the explicit
cipher used by the client is necessary.
.SS OpenVPN 2.4 server
.sp
When a client indicates support for \fIAES\-128\-GCM\fP and \fIAES\-256\-GCM\fP
(with \fBIV_NCP=2\fP) an OpenVPN 2.4 server will send the first
cipher of the \fB\-\-ncp\-ciphers\fP to the OpenVPN client regardless of what
the cipher is. To emulate the behaviour of an OpenVPN 2.4 client as close
as possible and have compatibility to a setup that depends on this quirk,
adding  \fIAES\-128\-GCM\fP and \fIAES\-256\-GCM\fP to the client\(aqs \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP
option is required. OpenVPN 2.5+ will only announce the \fBIV_NCP=2\fP flag if
those ciphers are present.
.SS OpenVPN 2.3 and older servers (and servers with \fB\-\-ncp\-disable\fP)
.sp
The cipher used by the server must be included in \fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP to
allow the client connecting to a server without cipher negotiation
support.
(For compatibility OpenVPN 2.5 will also accept the cipher set with
\fB\-\-cipher\fP)
.sp
If the server is 2.3 or older and  has been configured with the
\fB\-\-enable\-small\fP \fB\&./configure\fP argument, adding
\fB\-\-data\-ciphers\-fallback cipher\fP to the client config with the explicit
cipher used by the server is necessary.
.SS Blowfish in CBC mode (BF\-CBC) deprecation
.sp
The \fB\-\-cipher\fP option defaulted to \fIBF\-CBC\fP in OpenVPN 2.4 and older
version. The default was never changed to ensure backwards compatibility.
In OpenVPN 2.5 this behaviour has now been changed so that if the \fB\-\-cipher\fP
is not explicitly set it does not allow the weak \fIBF\-CBC\fP cipher any more
and needs to explicitly added as \fB\-\-cipher BFC\-CBC\fP or added to
\fB\-\-data\-ciphers\fP\&.
.sp
We strongly recommend to switching away from BF\-CBC to a
more secure cipher as soon as possible instead.
.SH NETWORK CONFIGURATION
.sp
OpenVPN consists of two sides of network configuration.  One side is the
\fIlink\fP between the local and remote side, the other side is the \fIvirtual
network adapter\fP (tun/tap device).
.SS Link Options
.sp
This link options section covers options related to the connection between
the local and the remote host.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-bind \ keywords
Bind to local address and port. This is the default unless any of
\fB\-\-proto tcp\-client\fP , \fB\-\-http\-proxy\fP or \fB\-\-socks\-proxy\fP are used.
.sp
If the optional \fBipv6only\fP keyword is present OpenVPN will bind only
to IPv6 (as opposed to IPv6 and IPv4) when a IPv6 socket is opened.
.TP
.B  \-\-float
Allow remote peer to change its IP address and/or port number, such as
due to DHCP (this is the default if \fB\-\-remote\fP is not used).
\fB\-\-float\fP when specified with \fB\-\-remote\fP allows an OpenVPN session
to initially connect to a peer at a known address, however if packets
arrive from a new address and pass all authentication tests, the new
address will take control of the session. This is useful when you are
connecting to a peer which holds a dynamic address such as a dial\-in
user or DHCP client.
.sp
Essentially, \fB\-\-float\fP tells OpenVPN to accept authenticated packets
from any address, not only the address which was specified in the
\fB\-\-remote\fP option.
.TP
.BI \-\-fragment \ args

.sp
Enable internal datagram fragmentation so that no UDP datagrams are sent
which are larger than \fBmax\fP bytes.
.sp
If the \fBmtu\fP parameter is present the \fBmax\fP parameter is
interpreted to include IP and UDP encapsulation overhead. The
\fBmtu\fP parameter is introduced in OpenVPN version 2.6.0.
.sp
If the \fBmtu\fP parameter is absent, the \fBmax\fP parameter is
interpreted in the same way as the \fB\-\-link\-mtu\fP parameter, i.e.
the UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead has been added in,
but not including the UDP header itself.
.sp
The \fB\-\-fragment\fP option only makes sense when you are using the UDP
protocol (\fB\-\-proto udp\fP).
.sp
\fB\-\-fragment\fP adds 4 bytes of overhead per datagram.
.sp
See the \fB\-\-mssfix\fP option below for an important related option to
\fB\-\-fragment\fP\&.
.sp
It should also be noted that this option is not meant to replace UDP
fragmentation at the IP stack level. It is only meant as a last resort
when path MTU discovery is broken. Using this option is less efficient
than fixing path MTU discovery for your IP link and using native IP
fragmentation instead.
.sp
Having said that, there are circumstances where using OpenVPN\(aqs internal
fragmentation capability may be your only option, such as tunneling a
UDP multicast stream which requires fragmentation.
.TP
.BI \-\-keepalive \ args
A helper directive designed to simplify the expression of \fB\-\-ping\fP and

.UNINDENT

.sp
Send ping once every \fBinterval\fP seconds, restart if ping is not received
for \fBtimeout\fP seconds.
.sp
This option can be used on both client and server side, but it is enough
to add this on the server side as it will push appropriate \fB\-\-ping\fP
and \fB\-\-ping\-restart\fP options to the client. If used on both server and
client, the values pushed from server will override the client local
values.
.sp
The \fBtimeout\fP argument will be twice as long on the server side. This
ensures that a timeout is detected on client side before the server side
drops the connection.
.sp
For example, \fB\-\-keepalive 10 60\fP expands as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if mode server:
    ping 10                    # Argument: interval

\fBDEPRECATED\fP Sets an upper bound on the size of UDP packets which are sent between
OpenVPN peers. \fIIt\(aqs best not to set this parameter unless you know what
you\(aqre doing.\fP
.sp
Due to variable header size of IP header (20 bytes for IPv4 and 40 bytes
for IPv6) and dynamically negotiated data channel cipher, this option
is not reliable. It is recommended to set tun\-mtu with enough headroom
instead.
.TP
.BI \-\-local \ host
Local host name or IP address for bind. If specified, OpenVPN will bind
to this address only. If unspecified, OpenVPN will bind to all
interfaces.
.TP
.BI \-\-lport \ port
Set local TCP/UDP port number or name. Cannot be used together with
\fB\-\-nobind\fP option.
.TP
.BI \-\-mark \ value
Mark encrypted packets being sent with \fBvalue\fP\&. The mark value can be
matched in policy routing and packetfilter rules. This option is only
supported in Linux and does nothing on other operating systems.
.TP
.BI \-\-mode \ m
Set OpenVPN major mode. By default, OpenVPN runs in point\-to\-point mode
(\fBp2p\fP). OpenVPN 2.0 introduces a new mode (\fBserver\fP) which
implements a multi\-client server capability.

.sp
Announce to TCP sessions running over the tunnel that they should limit
their send packet sizes such that after OpenVPN has encapsulated them,
the resulting UDP packet size that OpenVPN sends to its peer will not
exceed \fBmax\fP bytes. The default value is \fB1492 mtu\fP\&. Use \fB0\fP
as max to disable mssfix.
.sp
If the \fBmtu\fP parameter is specified the \fBmax\fP value is interpreted
as the resulting packet size of VPN packets including the IP and UDP header.
Support for the \fBmtu\fP parameter was added with OpenVPN version 2.6.0.
.sp
If the \fBmtu\fP parameter is not specified, the \fBmax\fP parameter
is interpreted in the same way as the \fB\-\-link\-mtu\fP parameter, i.e.
the UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead has been added in, but
not including the UDP header itself. Resulting packet would be at most 28
bytes larger for IPv4 and 48 bytes for IPv6 (20/40 bytes for IP header and
8 bytes for UDP header). Default value of 1450 allows OpenVPN packets to be
transmitted over IPv4 on a link with MTU 1478 or higher without IP level
fragmentation (and 1498 for IPv6).
.sp
If the \fBfixed\fP parameter is specified, OpenVPN will make no attempt
to calculate the VPN encapsulation overhead but instead will set the MSS to
limit the size of the payload IP packets to the specified number. IPv4 packets
will have the MSS value lowered to mssfix \- 40 and IPv6 packets to mssfix \- 60.
.sp
if \fB\-\-mssfix\fP is specified is specified without any parameter it
inherits the parameters of \fB\-\-fragment\fP if specified or uses the
default for \fB\-\-mssfix\fP otherwise.
.sp
The \fB\-\-mssfix\fP option only makes sense when you are using the UDP
protocol for OpenVPN peer\-to\-peer communication, i.e. \fB\-\-proto udp\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-mssfix\fP and \fB\-\-fragment\fP can be ideally used together, where
\fB\-\-mssfix\fP will try to keep TCP from needing packet fragmentation in
the first place, and if big packets come through anyhow (from protocols
other than TCP), \fB\-\-fragment\fP will internally fragment them.
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-packet\-size\fP, \fB\-\-fragment\fP, and \fB\-\-mssfix\fP are designed to
work around cases where Path MTU discovery is broken on the network path
between OpenVPN peers.
.sp
The usual symptom of such a breakdown is an OpenVPN connection which
successfully starts, but then stalls during active usage.
.sp
If \fB\-\-fragment\fP and \fB\-\-mssfix\fP are used together, \fB\-\-mssfix\fP will
take its default \fBmax\fP parameter from the \fB\-\-fragment max\fP option.
.sp
Therefore, one could lower the maximum UDP packet size to 1300 (a good
first try for solving MTU\-related connection problems) with the
following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

If the \fBmax\-packet\-size size\fP option is used in the configuration
it will also act as if \fBmssfix size mtu\fP was specified in the
configuration.
.TP
.BI \-\-mtu\-disc \ type
Should we do Path MTU discovery on TCP/UDP channel? Only supported on
OSes such as Linux that supports the necessary system call to set.

Valid types:
.sp
\fBno\fP      Never send DF (Don\(aqt Fragment) frames

\fBmaybe\fP   Use per\-route hints
.sp
\fByes\fP     Always DF (Don\(aqt Fragment)
.TP
.B  \-\-mtu\-test
To empirically measure MTU on connection startup, add the \fB\-\-mtu\-test\fP
option to your configuration. OpenVPN will send ping packets of various
sizes to the remote peer and measure the largest packets which were
successfully received. The \fB\-\-mtu\-test\fP process normally takes about 3
minutes to complete.
.TP
.B  \-\-nobind
Do not bind to local address and port. The IP stack will allocate a
dynamic port for returning packets. Since the value of the dynamic port
could not be known in advance by a peer, this option is only suitable
for peers which will be initiating connections by using the \fB\-\-remote\fP
option.
.TP
.B  \-\-passtos
Set the TOS field of the tunnel packet to what the payload\(aqs TOS is.
.TP
.BI \-\-ping \ n
Ping remote over the TCP/UDP control channel if no packets have been
sent for at least \fBn\fP seconds (specify \fB\-\-ping\fP on both peers to
cause ping packets to be sent in both directions since OpenVPN ping
packets are not echoed like IP ping packets). When used in one of
OpenVPN\(aqs secure modes (where \fB\-\-secret\fP, \fB\-\-tls\-server\fP or
\fB\-\-tls\-client\fP is specified), the ping packet will be
cryptographically secure.
.sp
This option has two intended uses:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
Compatibility with stateful firewalls. The periodic ping will ensure
that a stateful firewall rule which allows OpenVPN UDP packets to
pass will not time out.
.IP 2. 3
To provide a basis for the remote to test the existence of its peer
using the \fB\-\-ping\-exit\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When using OpenVPN in server mode see also \fB\-\-keepalive\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-\-ping\-exit \ n
Causes OpenVPN to exit after \fBn\fP seconds pass without reception of a
ping or other packet from remote. This option can be combined with
\fB\-\-inactive\fP, \fB\-\-ping\fP and \fB\-\-ping\-exit\fP to create a two\-tiered
inactivity disconnect.
.sp
For example,
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
openvpn [options...] \-\-inactive 3600 \-\-ping 10 \-\-ping\-exit 60
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
when used on both peers will cause OpenVPN to exit within 60 seconds if
its peer disconnects, but will exit after one hour if no actual tunnel
data is exchanged.
.TP
.BI \-\-ping\-restart \ n
Similar to \fB\-\-ping\-exit\fP, but trigger a \fBSIGUSR1\fP restart after
\fBn\fP seconds pass without reception of a ping or other packet from
remote.
.sp
This option is useful in cases where the remote peer has a dynamic IP
address and a low\-TTL DNS name is used to track the IP address using a
service such as \fI\%https://www.nsupdate.info/\fP + a dynamic DNS client such as
\fBddclient\fP\&.
.sp
If the peer cannot be reached, a restart will be triggered, causing the
hostname used with \fB\-\-remote\fP to be re\-resolved (if \fB\-\-resolv\-retry\fP
is also specified).
.sp
In server mode, \fB\-\-ping\-restart\fP, \fB\-\-inactive\fP or any other type of
internally generated signal will always be applied to individual client
instance objects, never to whole server itself. Note also in server mode
that any internally generated signal which would normally cause a
restart, will cause the deletion of the client instance object instead.
.sp
In client mode, the \fB\-\-ping\-restart\fP parameter is set to 120 seconds
by default. This default will hold until the client pulls a replacement
value from the server, based on the \fB\-\-keepalive\fP setting in the
server configuration. To disable the 120 second default, set
\fB\-\-ping\-restart 0\fP on the client.
.sp
See the signals section below for more information on \fBSIGUSR1\fP\&.
.sp
Note that the behavior of \fBSIGUSR1\fP can be modified by the
\fB\-\-persist\-tun\fP, \fB\-\-persist\-key\fP, \fB\-\-persist\-local\-ip\fP and
\fB\-\-persist\-remote\-ip\fP options.
.sp
Also note that \fB\-\-ping\-exit\fP and \fB\-\-ping\-restart\fP are mutually
exclusive and cannot be used together.
.TP
.B  \-\-ping\-timer\-rem
Run the \fB\-\-ping\-exit\fP / \fB\-\-ping\-restart\fP timer only if we have a
remote address. Use this option if you are starting the daemon in listen
mode (i.e. without an explicit \fB\-\-remote\fP peer), and you don\(aqt want to
start clocking timeouts until a remote peer connects.
.TP
.BI \-\-proto \ p
Use protocol \fBp\fP for communicating with remote host. \fBp\fP can be
\fBudp\fP, \fBtcp\-client\fP, or \fBtcp\-server\fP\&. You can also
limit OpenVPN to use only IPv4 or only IPv6 by specifying \fBp\fP as
\fBudp4\fP, \fBtcp4\-client\fP, \fBtcp4\-server\fP or \fBudp6\fP,
\fBtcp6\-client\fP, \fBtcp6\-server\fP, respectively.
.sp
The default protocol is \fBudp\fP when \fB\-\-proto\fP is not specified.
.sp
For UDP operation, \fB\-\-proto udp\fP should be specified on both peers.
.sp
For TCP operation, one peer must use \fB\-\-proto tcp\-server\fP and the
other must use \fB\-\-proto tcp\-client\fP\&. A peer started with
\fBtcp\-server\fP will wait indefinitely for an incoming connection. A peer
started with \fBtcp\-client\fP will attempt to connect, and if that fails,
will sleep for 5 seconds (adjustable via the \fB\-\-connect\-retry\fP option)
and try again infinite or up to N retries (adjustable via the
\fB\-\-connect\-retry\-max\fP option). Both TCP client and server will
simulate a SIGUSR1 restart signal if either side resets the connection.
.sp
OpenVPN is designed to operate optimally over UDP, but TCP capability is
provided for situations where UDP cannot be used. In comparison with
UDP, TCP will usually be somewhat less efficient and less robust when
used over unreliable or congested networks.
.sp
This article outlines some of problems with tunneling IP over TCP:
\fI\%http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp\-tcp.html\fP
.sp
There are certain cases, however, where using TCP may be advantageous
from a security and robustness perspective, such as tunneling non\-IP or
application\-level UDP protocols, or tunneling protocols which don\(aqt
possess a built\-in reliability layer.
.TP
.BI \-\-port \ port
TCP/UDP port number or port name for both local and remote (sets both
\fB\-\-lport\fP and \fB\-\-rport\fP options to given port). The current default

and has been used since version 2.0\-beta17. Previous versions used port
5000 as the default.

Use a replay protection sliding\-window of size \fBn\fP and a time window

.sp
By default \fBn\fP is \fB64\fP (the IPSec default) and \fBt\fP is
\fB15\fP seconds.
.sp
This option is only relevant in UDP mode, i.e. when either \fB\-\-proto
udp\fP is specified, or no \fB\-\-proto\fP option is specified.
.sp
When OpenVPN tunnels IP packets over UDP, there is the possibility that
packets might be dropped or delivered out of order. Because OpenVPN,
like IPSec, is emulating the physical network layer, it will accept an
out\-of\-order packet sequence, and will deliver such packets in the same
order they were received to the TCP/IP protocol stack, provided they
satisfy several constraints.
.INDENT 7.0
.IP a. 3
The packet cannot be a replay (unless \fB\-\-no\-replay\fP is
specified, which disables replay protection altogether).
.IP b. 3
If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if
the difference between its sequence number and the highest sequence
number received so far is less than \fBn\fP\&.
.IP c. 3
If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if it
arrives no later than \fBt\fP seconds after any packet containing a higher
sequence number.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you are using a network link with a large pipeline (meaning that the
product of bandwidth and latency is high), you may want to use a larger
value for \fBn\fP\&. Satellite links in particular often require this.
.sp
If you run OpenVPN at \fB\-\-verb 4\fP, you will see the message
\(dqPID_ERR replay\-window backtrack occurred [x]\(dq every time the maximum sequence
number backtrack seen thus far increases. This can be used to calibrate
\fBn\fP\&.
.sp
There is some controversy on the appropriate method of handling packet
reordering at the security layer.
.sp
Namely, to what extent should the security layer protect the
encapsulated protocol from attacks which masquerade as the kinds of
normal packet loss and reordering that occur over IP networks?
.sp
The IPSec and OpenVPN approach is to allow packet reordering within a
certain fixed sequence number window.
.sp
OpenVPN adds to the IPSec model by limiting the window size in time as
well as sequence space.
.sp
OpenVPN also adds TCP transport as an option (not offered by IPSec) in
which case OpenVPN can adopt a very strict attitude towards message
deletion and reordering: Don\(aqt allow it. Since TCP guarantees
reliability, any packet loss or reordering event can be assumed to be an
attack.
.sp
In this sense, it could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is preferred
when tunneling non\-IP or UDP application protocols which might be
vulnerable to a message deletion or reordering attack which falls within
the normal operational parameters of IP networks.
.sp
So I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non\-IP
protocol or UDP application protocol over UDP, if the protocol might be
vulnerable to a message deletion or reordering attack that falls within
the normal operating parameters of what is to be expected from the
physical IP layer. The problem is easily fixed by simply using TCP as
the VPN transport layer.
.TP
.BI \-\-replay\-persist \ file
Persist replay\-protection state across sessions using \fBfile\fP to save
and reload the state.
.sp
This option will keep a disk copy of the current replay protection state
(i.e. the most recent packet timestamp and sequence number received from
the remote peer), so that if an OpenVPN session is stopped and
restarted, it will reject any replays of packets which were already
received by the prior session.
.sp
This option only makes sense when replay protection is enabled (the
default) and you are using either \fB\-\-secret\fP (shared\-secret key mode)
or TLS mode with \fB\-\-tls\-auth\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-\-session\-timeout \ n
Raises \fBSIGTERM\fP for the client instance after \fBn\fP seconds since
the beginning of the session, forcing OpenVPN to disconnect.
In client mode, OpenVPN will disconnect and exit, while in server mode
all client sessions are terminated.
.sp
This option can also be specified in a client instance config file
using \fB\-\-client\-config\-dir\fP or dynamically generated using a
\fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script. In these cases, only the related client
session is terminated.
.TP
.BI \-\-socket\-flags \ flags
Apply the given flags to the OpenVPN transport socket. Currently, only
\fBTCP_NODELAY\fP is supported.
.sp
The \fBTCP_NODELAY\fP socket flag is useful in TCP mode, and causes the
kernel to send tunnel packets immediately over the TCP connection without
trying to group several smaller packets into a larger packet.  This can
result in a considerably improvement in latency.
.sp
This option is pushable from server to client, and should be used on
both client and server for maximum effect.
.TP
.B  \-\-tcp\-nodelay
This macro sets the \fBTCP_NODELAY\fP socket flag on the server as well
as pushes it to connecting clients. The \fBTCP_NODELAY\fP flag disables
the Nagle algorithm on TCP sockets causing packets to be transmitted
immediately with low latency, rather than waiting a short period of time
in order to aggregate several packets into a larger containing packet.
In VPN applications over TCP, \fBTCP_NODELAY\fP is generally a good
latency optimization.
.sp
The macro expands as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.BI \-\-max\-packet\-size \ size
This option will instruct OpenVPN to try to limit the maximum on\-write packet
size by restricting the control channel packet size and setting \fB\-\-mssfix\fP\&.
.sp
OpenVPN will try to keep its control channel messages below this size but
due to some constraints in the protocol this is not always possible. If the
option is not set, the control packet maximum size defaults to 1250.
The control channel packet size will be restricted to values between
154 and 2048. The maximum packet size includes encapsulation overhead like
UDP and IP.
.sp
In terms of \fB\-\-mssfix\fP it will expand to:
.INDENT 7.0

If you need to set \fB\-\-mssfix\fP for data channel and control channel maximum

.sp
In general the default size of 1250 should work almost universally apart
from specific corner cases, especially since IPv6 requires a MTU of 1280
or larger.

On the client, instead of sending IPv6 packets over the VPN tunnel, all
IPv6 packets are answered with an ICMPv6 no route host message. On the
server, all IPv6 packets from clients are answered with an ICMPv6 no
route to host message. This options is intended for cases when IPv6
should be blocked and other options are not available. \fB\-\-block\-ipv6\fP

otherwise will use \fBfe80::7\fP as source address.

For this option to make sense you actually have to route traffic to the
tun interface. The following example config block would send all IPv6
traffic to OpenVPN and answer all requests with no route to host,
effectively blocking IPv6 (to avoid IPv6 connections from dual\-stacked
clients leaking around IPv4\-only VPN services).

What happens if the device name is not \fBtun\fP or \fBtap\fP is
platform dependent.
.sp
On most platforms, \fBtunN\fP (e.g. tun2, tun30) and \fBtapN\fP
(e.g. tap3) will create a numbered tun/tap interface with the number
specified \- this is useful if multiple OpenVPN instances are active,
and the instance\-to\-device mapping needs to be known.  Some platforms
do not support \(dqnumbered tap\(dq, so trying \fB\-\-dev tap3\fP will fail.
.sp
Arbitrary device names (e.g. \fB\-\-dev tun\-home\fP) will only work on
FreeBSD (with the DCO kernel driver for \fBtun\fP devices) and Linux
(for both \fBtun\fP and \fBtap\fP devices, DCO and tun/tap driver).
.sp
If such a device name starts with \fBtun\fP or \fBtap\fP (e.g. \fBtun\-home\fP),
OpenVPN will choose the right device type automatically.  Otherwise the
desired device type needs to be specified with \fB\-\-dev\-type tun\fP or
\fB\-\-dev\-type tap\fP\&.
.sp
On Windows, only the names \fBtun\fP and \fBtap\fP are supported.
Selection among multiple installed drivers or driver instances is done
with \fB\-\-dev\-node\fP and \fB\-\-windows\-driver\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-\-dev\-node \ node
This is a highly system dependent option to influence tun/tap driver
selection.
.sp
On Linux, tun/tap devices are created by accessing \fB/dev/net/tun\fP,
and this device name can be changed using \fB\-\-dev\-node ...\fP\&.
.sp
Under Mac OS X this option can be used to specify the default tun
implementation. Using \fB\-\-dev\-node utun\fP forces usage of the native
Darwin tun kernel support. Use \fB\-\-dev\-node utunN\fP to select a specific
utun instance. To force using the \fBtun.kext\fP (\fB/dev/tunX\fP)
use \fB\-\-dev\-node tun\fP\&. When not specifying a \fB\-\-dev\-node\fP option
openvpn will first try to open utun, and fall back to tun.kext.
.sp
On Windows systems, select the TAP\-Win32 adapter which is named \fBnode\fP
in the Network Connections Control Panel or the raw GUID of the adapter
enclosed by braces. The \fB\-\-show\-adapters\fP option under Windows can
also be used to enumerate all available TAP\-Win32 adapters and will show
both the network connections control panel name and the GUID for each
TAP\-Win32 adapter.
.sp
On other platforms, \fB\-\-dev\-node node\fP will influence the naming of the
created tun/tap device, if supported on that platform.  If OpenVPN cannot
figure out whether \fBnode\fP is a TUN or TAP device based on the name,
you should also specify \fB\-\-dev\-type tun\fP or \fB\-\-dev\-type tap\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-\-dev\-type \ device\-type
Which device type are we using? \fBdevice\-type\fP should be \fBtun\fP

.BI \-\-dhcp\-option \ args
Set additional network parameters on supported platforms. May be specified

\fBOpenVPN for Android\fP client also handles them internally.
.sp
On all other platforms these options are only saved in the client\(aqs

.BI \-\-ifconfig \ args
Set TUN/TAP adapter parameters. It requires the \fIIP address\fP of the local

must be the VPN IP address of the remote VPN endpoint. For TAP devices,
or TUN devices used with \fB\-\-topology subnet\fP, the second argument
is the subnet mask of the virtual network segment which is being created
or connected to.
.sp
For TUN devices, which facilitate virtual point\-to\-point IP connections
(when used in \fB\-\-topology net30\fP or \fBp2p\fP mode), the proper usage of
\fB\-\-ifconfig\fP is to use two private IP addresses which are not a member
of any existing subnet which is in use. The IP addresses may be
consecutive and should have their order reversed on the remote peer.
After the VPN is established, by pinging \fBrn\fP, you will be pinging
across the VPN.
.sp
For TAP devices, which provide the ability to create virtual ethernet
segments, or TUN devices in \fB\-\-topology subnet\fP mode (which create
virtual \(dqmultipoint networks\(dq), \fB\-\-ifconfig\fP is used to set an IP
address and subnet mask just as a physical ethernet adapter would be
similarly configured. If you are attempting to connect to a remote
ethernet bridge, the IP address and subnet should be set to values which
would be valid on the bridged ethernet segment (note also that DHCP
can be used for the same purpose).
.sp
This option, while primarily a proxy for the \fBifconfig\fP(8) command,
is designed to simplify TUN/TAP tunnel configuration by providing a
standard interface to the different ifconfig implementations on
different platforms.
.sp
\fB\-\-ifconfig\fP parameters which are IP addresses can also be specified

The MTU (Maximum Transmission Units) is the maximum datagram size in

(Standalone) Create a persistent tunnel on platforms which support them

time that an application has them open. This option takes advantage of
the TUN/TAP driver\(aqs ability to build persistent tunnels that live
through multiple instantiations of OpenVPN and die only when they are
deleted or the machine is rebooted.
.sp
One of the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate the
need for separate \fB\-\-up\fP and \fB\-\-down\fP scripts to run the appropriate
\fBifconfig\fP(8) and \fBroute\fP(8) commands. These commands can be
placed in the same shell script which starts or terminates an
OpenVPN session.
.sp
Another advantage is that open connections through the TUN/TAP\-based
tunnel will not be reset if the OpenVPN peer restarts. This can be
useful to provide uninterrupted connectivity through the tunnel in the
event of a DHCP reset of the peer\(aqs public IP address (see the
\fB\-\-ipchange\fP option above).

.SS Virtual Routing and Forwarding
.sp
Options in this section relates to configuration of virtual routing and
forwarding in combination with the underlying operating system.
.sp
As of today this is only supported on Linux, a kernel >= 4.9 is
recommended.
.sp
This could come in handy when for example the external network should be
only used as a means to connect to some VPN endpoints and all regular
traffic should only be routed through any tunnel(s).  This could be
achieved by setting up a VRF and configuring the interface connected to
the external network to be part of the VRF. The examples below will cover
this setup.
.sp
Another option would be to put the tun/tap interface into a VRF. This could
be done by an up\-script which uses the \fBip link set\fP command shown
below.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
OpenVPN will run command \fBcmd\fP to validate the username/password
provided by the client.
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
If \fBmethod\fP is set to \fBvia\-env\fP, OpenVPN will call \fBcmd\fP
with the environmental variables \fBusername\fP and \fBpassword\fP
set to the username/password strings provided by the client. \fIBeware\fP
that this method is insecure on some platforms which make the environment
of a process publicly visible to other unprivileged processes.
.sp
If \fBmethod\fP is set to \fBvia\-file\fP, OpenVPN will write the username
and password to the first two lines of a temporary file. The filename
will be passed as an argument to \fBcmd\fP, and the file will be
automatically deleted by OpenVPN after the script returns. The location
of the temporary file is controlled by the \fB\-\-tmp\-dir\fP option, and
will default to the current directory if unspecified. For security,
consider setting \fB\-\-tmp\-dir\fP to a volatile storage medium such as
\fB/dev/shm\fP (if available) to prevent the username/password file
from touching the hard drive.
.sp
The script should examine the username and password, returning a success
exit code (\fB0\fP) if the client\(aqs authentication request is to be
accepted, a failure code (\fB1\fP) to reject the client, or a that
the authentication is deferred (\fB2\fP). If the authentication is
deferred, the script must fork/start a background or another non\-blocking
operation to continue the authentication in the background. When finshing
the authentication, a \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP must be written to the
file specified by the \fBauth_control_file\fP\&.
.sp
If the file specified by \fBauth_failed_reason_file\fP exists and has
non\-empty content, the content of this file will be used as AUTH_FAILED
message. To avoid race conditions, this file should be written before
\fBauth_control_file\fP\&.
.sp
This auth fail reason can be something simple like \(dqUser has been permanently
disabled\(dq but there are also some special auth failed messages.
.sp
The \fBTEMP\fP message indicates that the authentication
temporarily failed and that the client should continue to retry to connect.
The server can optionally give a user readable message and hint the client a
behavior how to proceed. The keywords of the \fBAUTH_FAILED,TEMP\fP message
are comma separated keys/values and provide a hint to the client how to
proceed. Currently defined keywords are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBbackoff\fP \fBs\fP
instructs the client to wait at least \fBs\fP seconds before the next
connection attempt. If the client already uses a higher delay for
reconnection attempt, the delay will not be shortened.
.TP
.B \fBadvance addr\fP
Instructs the client to reconnect to the next (IP) address of the
current server.
.TP
.B \fBadvance remote\fP
Instructs the client to skip the remaining IP addresses of the current
server and instead connect to the next server specified in the
configuration file.
.TP
.B \fBadvance no\fP
Instructs the client to retry connecting to the same server again.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, the message \fBTEMP[backoff 42,advance no]: No free IP addresses\fP
indicates that the VPN connection can currently not succeed and instructs
the client to retry in 42 seconds again.
.sp
When deferred authentication is in use, the script can also request
pending authentication by writing to the file specified by the
\fBauth_pending_file\fP\&. The first line must be the timeout in
seconds, the required method on the second line (e.g. crtext) and
third line must be the EXTRA as documented in the
\fBclient\-pending\-auth\fP section of \fIdoc/management.txt\fP\&.
.sp
This directive is designed to enable a plugin\-style interface for
extending OpenVPN\(aqs authentication capabilities.
.sp
To protect against a client passing a maliciously formed username or
password string, the username string must consist only of these
characters: alphanumeric, underbar (\(aq\fB_\fP\(aq), dash (\(aq\fB\-\fP\(aq),
dot (\(aq\fB\&.\fP\(aq), or at (\(aq\fB@\fP\(aq). The password string can consist
of any printable characters except for CR or LF. Any illegal characters
in either the username or password string will be converted to
underbar (\(aq\fB_\fP\(aq).
.sp
Care must be taken by any user\-defined scripts to avoid creating a
security vulnerability in the way that these strings are handled. Never
use these strings in such a way that they might be escaped or evaluated
by a shell interpreter.

OpenVPN will write the response of the client into a temporary file.
The filename will be passed as an argument to \fBcmd\fP, and the file will be
automatically deleted by OpenVPN after the script returns.
.sp
The response is passed as is from the client. The script needs to check
itself if the input is valid, e.g. if the input is valid base64 encoding.
.sp
The script can either directly write the result of the verification to
\fBauth_control_file or further defer it. See \(ga\fP\-\-auth\-user\-pass\-verify\(ga\(ga
for details.
.sp

.TP
.BI \-\-client\-connect \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP on client connection.
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
The command is passed the common name and IP address of the
just\-authenticated client as environmental variables (see environmental
variable section below). The command is also passed the pathname of a
freshly created temporary file as the last argument (after any arguments
specified in \fBcmd\fP ), to be used by the command to pass dynamically
generated config file directives back to OpenVPN.
.sp
If the script wants to generate a dynamic config file to be applied on
the server when the client connects, it should write it to the file
named by the last argument.
.sp
See the \fB\-\-client\-config\-dir\fP option below for options which can be
legally used in a dynamically generated config file.
.sp
Note that the return value of \fBscript\fP is significant. If \fBscript\fP
returns a non\-zero error status, it will cause the client to be
disconnected.
.sp
If a \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP wants to defer the generating of the
configuration then the script needs to use the
\fBclient_connect_deferred_file\fP and
\fBclient_connect_config_file\fP environment variables, and write
status accordingly into these files.  See the \fI\%Environmental Variables\fP
section for more details.
.TP
.BI \-\-client\-disconnect \ cmd
Like \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP but called on client instance shutdown. Will
not be called unless the \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script and plugins (if
defined) were previously called on this instance with successful (0)
status returns.
.sp
The exception to this rule is if the \fB\-\-client\-disconnect\fP command or
plugins are cascaded, and at least one client\-connect function
succeeded, then ALL of the client\-disconnect functions for scripts and
plugins will be called on client instance object deletion, even in cases
where some of the related client\-connect functions returned an error
status.
.sp
The \fB\-\-client\-disconnect\fP command is not passed any extra arguments
(only those arguments specified in cmd, if any).
.TP
.BI \-\-down \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP after TUN/TAP device close (post \fB\-\-user\fP UID
change and/or \fB\-\-chroot\fP ). \fBcmd\fP consists of a path to script (or
executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and
arguments may be single\- or double\-quoted and/or escaped using a
backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
.sp
Called with the same parameters and environmental variables as the
\fB\-\-up\fP option above.
.sp
Note that if you reduce privileges by using \fB\-\-user\fP and/or
\fB\-\-group\fP, your \fB\-\-down\fP script will also run at reduced privilege.
.TP
.B  \-\-down\-pre
Call \fB\-\-down\fP cmd/script before, rather than after, TUN/TAP close.
.TP
.BI \-\-ipchange \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP when our remote ip\-address is initially
authenticated or changes.
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
When \fBcmd\fP is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments
specified in \fBcmd\fP , as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cmd ip address port number
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
Don\(aqt use \fB\-\-ipchange\fP in \fB\-\-mode server\fP mode. Use a
\fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script instead.
.sp
See the \fI\%Environmental Variables\fP section below for additional
parameters passed as environmental variables.
.sp
If you are running in a dynamic IP address environment where the IP
addresses of either peer could change without notice, you can use this
script, for example, to edit the \fB/etc/hosts\fP file with the current
address of the peer. The script will be run every time the remote peer
changes its IP address.
.sp
Similarly if \fIour\fP IP address changes due to DHCP, we should configure
our IP address change script (see man page for \fBdhcpcd\fP(8)) to
deliver a \fBSIGHUP\fP or \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal to OpenVPN. OpenVPN will
then re\-establish a connection with its most recently authenticated
peer on its new IP address.
.TP
.BI \-\-learn\-address \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP to validate client virtual addresses or routes.
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
Three arguments will be appended to any arguments in \fBcmd\fP as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB$1\fP \- [operation]
\fB\(dqadd\(dq\fP, \fB\(dqupdate\(dq\fP, or \fB\(dqdelete\(dq\fP based on whether
or not the address is being added to, modified, or deleted from
OpenVPN\(aqs internal routing table.
.TP
.B \fB$2\fP \- [address]
The address being learned or unlearned. This can be an IPv4 address
such as \fB\(dq198.162.10.14\(dq\fP, an IPv4 subnet such as
\fB\(dq198.162.10.0/24\(dq\fP, or an ethernet MAC address (when
\fB\-\-dev tap\fP is being used) such as \fB\(dq00:FF:01:02:03:04\(dq\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$3\fP \- [common name]
The common name on the certificate associated with the client linked
to this address. Only present for \fB\(dqadd\(dq\fP or \fB\(dqupdate\(dq\fP
operations, not \fB\(dqdelete\(dq\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
On \fB\(dqadd\(dq\fP or \fB\(dqupdate\(dq\fP methods, if the script returns
a failure code (non\-zero), OpenVPN will reject the address and will not
modify its internal routing table.
.sp
Normally, the \fBcmd\fP script will use the information provided above to
set appropriate firewall entries on the VPN TUN/TAP interface. Since
OpenVPN provides the association between virtual IP or MAC address and
the client\(aqs authenticated common name, it allows a user\-defined script
to configure firewall access policies with regard to the client\(aqs
high\-level common name, rather than the low level client virtual
addresses.
.TP
.BI \-\-route\-up \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP after routes are added, subject to \fB\-\-route\-delay\fP\&.
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
See the \fI\%Environmental Variables\fP section below for additional
parameters passed as environmental variables.
.TP
.BI \-\-route\-pre\-down \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP before routes are removed upon disconnection.
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
See the \fI\%Environmental Variables\fP section below for additional

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By setting \fBFORWARD_COMPATIBLE\fP to \fB1\fP, the config file
syntax checking is relaxed so that unknown directives will trigger a
warning but not a fatal error, on the assumption that a given unknown
directive might be valid in future OpenVPN versions.
.sp
This option should be used with caution, as there are good security
reasons for having OpenVPN fail if it detects problems in a config file.
Having said that, there are valid reasons for wanting new software
features to gracefully degrade when encountered by older software
versions.
.sp
It is also possible to tag a single directive so as not to trigger a
fatal error if the directive isn\(aqt recognized. To do this, prepend the
following before the directive: \fBsetenv opt\fP
.sp
Versions prior to OpenVPN 2.3.3 will always ignore options set with the
\fBsetenv opt\fP directive.
.sp

This directive is designed to be pushed by the server to clients, and
the prepending of \fBOPENVPN_\fP to the environmental variable is a

malicious or compromised server.
.TP
.BI \-\-tls\-verify \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP to verify the X509 name of a pending TLS connection
that has otherwise passed all other tests of certification (except for
revocation via \fB\-\-crl\-verify\fP directive; the revocation test occurs
after the \fB\-\-tls\-verify\fP test).
.sp
\fBcmd\fP should return \fB0\fP to allow the TLS handshake to proceed,
or \fB1\fP to fail.
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
When \fBcmd\fP is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments
specified in \fBcmd\fP, as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cmd certificate_depth subject
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These arguments are, respectively, the current certificate depth and the
X509 subject distinguished name (dn) of the peer.
.sp
This feature is useful if the peer you want to trust has a certificate
which was signed by a certificate authority who also signed many other
certificates, where you don\(aqt necessarily want to trust all of them, but
rather be selective about which peer certificate you will accept. This
feature allows you to write a script which will test the X509 name on a
certificate and decide whether or not it should be accepted. For a
simple perl script which will test the common name field on the
certificate, see the file \fBverify\-cn\fP in the OpenVPN distribution.
.sp
See the \fI\%Environmental Variables\fP section below for additional
parameters passed as environmental variables.
.TP
.BI \-\-tls\-export\-cert \ dir
Adds an environment variable \fBpeer_cert\fP when calling the
\fB\-\-tls\-verify\fP script or executing the OPENVPN_PLUGIN_TLS_VERIFY plugin
hook to verify the certificate.
.sp
The environment variable contains the path to a PEM encoded certificate
of the current peer certificate in the directory \fBdir\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-\-up \ cmd
Run command \fBcmd\fP after successful TUN/TAP device open (pre \fB\-\-user\fP
UID change).
.sp
\fBcmd\fP consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally
followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single\- or
double\-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated
by one or more spaces.
.sp
The up command is useful for specifying route commands which route IP
traffic destined for private subnets which exist at the other end of the
VPN connection into the tunnel.
.sp
For \fB\-\-dev tun\fP execute as:
.INDENT 7.0

.sp
See the \fI\%Environmental Variables\fP section below for additional
parameters passed as environmental variables.  The \fB0\fP argument
used to be \fBlink_mtu\fP which is no longer passed to scripts \- to
keep the argument order, it was replaced with \fB0\fP\&.
.sp
Note that if \fBcmd\fP includes arguments, all OpenVPN\-generated arguments
will be appended to them to build an argument list with which the
executable will be called.
.sp
Typically, \fBcmd\fP will run a script to add routes to the tunnel.
.sp
Normally the up script is called after the TUN/TAP device is opened. In
this context, the last command line parameter passed to the script will
be \fIinit.\fP If the \fB\-\-up\-restart\fP option is also used, the up script
will be called for restarts as well. A restart is considered to be a
partial reinitialization of OpenVPN where the TUN/TAP instance is
preserved (the \fB\-\-persist\-tun\fP option will enable such preservation).
A restart can be generated by a SIGUSR1 signal, a \fB\-\-ping\-restart\fP
timeout, or a connection reset when the TCP protocol is enabled with the
\fB\-\-proto\fP option. If a restart occurs, and \fB\-\-up\-restart\fP has been
specified, the up script will be called with \fIrestart\fP as the last
parameter.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fINOTE:\fP
On restart, OpenVPN will not pass the full set of environment
variables to the script. Namely, everything related to routing and
gateways will not be passed, as nothing needs to be done anyway \- all
the routing setup is already in place. Additionally, the up\-restart
script will run with the downgraded UID/GID settings (if configured).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following standalone example shows how the \fB\-\-up\fP script can be
called in both an initialization and restart context. (\fINOTE:\fP for
security reasons, don\(aqt run the following example unless UDP port 9999

Note that OpenVPN also provides the \fB\-\-ifconfig\fP option to
automatically ifconfig the TUN device, eliminating the need to define an
\fB\-\-up\fP script, unless you also want to configure routes in the
\fB\-\-up\fP script.
.sp
If \fB\-\-ifconfig\fP is also specified, OpenVPN will pass the ifconfig
local and remote endpoints on the command line to the \fB\-\-up\fP script so

\fB\-\-ping\fP to allow connection initiation to be sensed in the absence of
tunnel data, since UDP is a \(dqconnectionless\(dq protocol.
.sp
On Windows, this option will delay the TAP\-Win32 media state
transitioning to \(dqconnected\(dq until connection establishment, i.e. the
receipt of the first authenticated packet from the peer.
.TP
.B  \-\-up\-restart
Enable the \fB\-\-up\fP and \fB\-\-down\fP scripts to be called for restarts as
well as initial program start. This option is described more fully above

.SS String Types and Remapping
.sp
In certain cases, OpenVPN will perform remapping of characters in
strings. Essentially, any characters outside the set of permitted
characters for each string type will be converted to underbar (\(aq_\(aq).
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIQ: Why is string remapping necessary?\fP
It\(aqs an important security feature to prevent the malicious
coding of strings from untrusted sources to be passed as parameters to
scripts, saved in the environment, used as a common name, translated to
a filename, etc.
.TP
.B \fIQ: Can string remapping be disabled?\fP
Yes, by using the \fB\-\-no\-name\-remapping\fP option, however this
should be considered an advanced option.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is a brief rundown of OpenVPN\(aqs current string types and the
permitted character class for each string:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIX509 Names\fP
Alphanumeric, underbar (\(aq_\(aq), dash (\(aq\-\(aq), dot (\(aq.\(aq), at
(\(aq@\(aq), colon (\(aq:\(aq), slash (\(aq/\(aq), and equal (\(aq=\(aq). Alphanumeric is
defined as a character which will cause the C library isalnum() function
to return true.
.TP
.B \fICommon Names\fP
Alphanumeric, underbar (\(aq_\(aq), dash (\(aq\-\(aq), dot (\(aq.\(aq), and at (\(aq@\(aq).
.TP
.B \fI\-\-auth\-user\-pass username\fP
Same as Common Name, with one exception:
starting with OpenVPN 2.0.1, the username is passed to the
\fBOPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY\fP plugin in its raw form,
without string remapping.
.TP
.B \fI\-\-auth\-user\-pass password\fP
Any \(dqprintable\(dq character except CR or LF. Printable is defined to be
a character which will cause the C library isprint() function to
return true.
.TP
.B \fI\-\-client\-config\-dir filename as derived from common name or\(gausername\fP
Alphanumeric, underbar (\(aq_\(aq), dash (\(aq\-\(aq), and dot (\(aq.\(aq) except for \(dq.\(dq
or \(dq..\(dq as standalone strings. As of v2.0.1\-rc6, the at (\(aq@\(aq) character
has been added as well for compatibility with the common name character
class.
.TP
.B \fIEnvironmental variable names\fP
Alphanumeric or underbar (\(aq_\(aq).
.TP
.B \fIEnvironmental variable values\fP
Any printable character.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For all cases, characters in a string which are not members of the legal
character class for that string type will be remapped to underbar
(\(aq_\(aq).
.SS Environmental Variables
.sp
Once set, a variable is persisted indefinitely until it is reset by a
new value or a restart,
.sp
As of OpenVPN 2.0\-beta12, in server mode, environmental variables set by
OpenVPN are scoped according to the client objects they are associated
with, so there should not be any issues with scripts having access to
stale, previously set variables which refer to different client
instances.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbytes_received\fP
Total number of bytes received from client during VPN session. Set prior
to execution of the \fB\-\-client\-disconnect\fP script.
.TP
.B \fBbytes_sent\fP
Total number of bytes sent to client during VPN session. Set prior to
execution of the \fB\-\-client\-disconnect\fP script.
.TP
.B \fBclient_connect_config_file\fP
The path to the configuration file that should be written to by the
\fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script (optional, if per\-session configuration
is desired).  This is the same file name as passed via command line
argument on the call to the \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script.
.TP
.B \fBclient_connect_deferred_file\fP
This file can be optionally written to in order to to communicate a
status code of the \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP script or plgin.  Only the
first character in the file is relevant.  It must be either \fB1\fP
to indicate normal script execution, \fB0\fP indicates an error (in
the same way that a non zero exit status does) or \fB2\fP to indicate
that the script deferred returning the config file.
.sp
For deferred (background) handling, the script or plugin MUST write
\fB2\fP to the file to indicate the deferral and then return with
exit code \fB0\fP to signal \fBdeferred handler started OK\fP\&.
.sp
A background process or similar must then take care of writing the
configuration to the file indicated by the
\fBclient_connect_config_file\fP environment variable and when
finished, write the a \fB1\fP to this file (or \fB0\fP in case of
an error).
.sp
The absence of any character in the file when the script finishes
executing is interpreted the same as \fB1\fP\&. This allows scripts
that are not written to support the defer mechanism to be used
unmodified.
.TP
.B \fBcommon_name\fP
The X509 common name of an authenticated client. Set prior to execution
of \fB\-\-client\-connect\fP, \fB\-\-client\-disconnect\fP and
\fB\-\-auth\-user\-pass\-verify\fP scripts.

exists. Set prior to \fB\-\-up\fP or \fB\-\-down\fP script execution.
.TP
.B \fBdev_idx\fP
On Windows, the device index of the TUN/TAP adapter (to be used in
netsh.exe calls which sometimes just do not work right with interface
names). Set prior to \fB\-\-up\fP or \fB\-\-down\fP script execution.
.TP
.B \fBdns_*\fP
The \fB\-\-dns\fP configuration options will be made available to script
execution through this set of environment variables. Variables appear
only if the corresponding option has a value assigned. For the semantics
of each individual variable, please refer to the documentation for \fB\-\-dns\fP\&.

\fBpw\-file\fP, if specified, is a password file where the password must
be on first line. Instead of a filename it can use the keyword stdin
which will prompt the user for a password to use when OpenVPN is
starting.
.sp
For unix sockets, the default behaviour is to create a unix domain
socket that may be connected to by any process. Use the
\fB\-\-management\-client\-user\fP and \fB\-\-management\-client\-group\fP
directives to restrict access.
.sp
The management interface provides a special mode where the TCP
management link can operate over the tunnel itself. To enable this mode,
set IP to \fBtunnel\fP\&. Tunnel mode will cause the management interface to
listen for a TCP connection on the local VPN address of the TUN/TAP
interface.
.sp
\fB*BEWARE*\fP of enabling the management interface over TCP. In these cases
you should \fIALWAYS\fP make use of \fBpw\-file\fP to password protect the
management interface. Any user who can connect to this TCP \fBIP:port\fP
will be able to manage and control (and interfere with) the OpenVPN
process. It is also strongly recommended to set IP to 127.0.0.1
(localhost) to restrict accessibility of the management server to local
clients.
.sp
While the management port is designed for programmatic control of
OpenVPN by other applications, it is possible to telnet to the port,
using a telnet client in \(dqraw\(dq mode. Once connected, type \fBhelp\fP

are configured for the same callback, the script will be called last. If
the return code of the module/script controls an authentication function

every module and script must return success (\fB0\fP) in order for the

will be configured to allow non\-admin access. The non\-admin access
setting will only persist for the length of time that the TAP\-Win32

.TP
.B  \-\-block\-outside\-dns
Block DNS servers on other network adapters to prevent DNS leaks. This
option prevents any application from accessing TCP or UDP port 53 except
one inside the tunnel. It uses Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) and
works on Windows Vista or later.
.sp
This option is considered unknown on non\-Windows platforms and
unsupported on Windows XP, resulting in fatal error. You may want to use
\fB\-\-setenv opt\fP or \fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\-option\fP (not suitable for
Windows XP) to ignore said error. Note that pushing unknown options from

This makes it possible to use any smart card, supported by Windows, but

Ask Windows to release the TAP adapter lease on shutdown. This option
has no effect now, as it is enabled by default starting with
OpenVPN 2.4.1.
.TP
.B  \-\-dhcp\-renew
Ask Windows to renew the TAP adapter lease on startup. This option is
normally unnecessary, as Windows automatically triggers a DHCP
renegotiation on the TAP adapter when it comes up, however if you set
the TAP\-Win32 adapter Media Status property to \(dqAlways Connected\(dq, you
may need this flag.
.TP
.BI \-\-ip\-win32 \ method
When using \fB\-\-ifconfig\fP on Windows, set the TAP\-Win32 adapter IP
address and netmask using \fBmethod\fP\&. Don\(aqt use this option unless you
are also using \fB\-\-ifconfig\fP\&.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBmanual\fP
Don\(aqt set the IP address or netmask automatically. Instead
output a message to the console telling the user to configure the
adapter manually and indicating the IP/netmask which OpenVPN
expects the adapter to be set to.
.TP
.B \fBdynamic [offset] [lease\-time]\fP
Automatically set the IP address and netmask by replying to DHCP
query messages generated by the kernel.  This mode is probably the
\(dqcleanest\(dq solution for setting the TCP/IP properties since it
uses the well\-known DHCP protocol. There are, however, two
prerequisites for using this mode:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
The TCP/IP properties for the TAP\-Win32 adapter must be set
to \(dqObtain an IP address automatically\(dq, and
.IP 2. 3
OpenVPN needs to claim an IP address in the subnet for use
as the virtual DHCP server address.
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default in \fB\-\-dev tap\fP mode, OpenVPN will take the normally
unused first address in the subnet. For example, if your subnet is
\fB192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0\fP, then OpenVPN will take
the IP address \fB192.168.4.0\fP to use as the virtual DHCP
server address.  In \fB\-\-dev tun\fP mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP
server to masquerade as if it were coming from the remote endpoint.
.sp
The optional offset parameter is an integer which is > \fB\-256\fP
and < \fB256\fP and which defaults to 0. If offset is positive,
the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address at network
address + offset. If offset is negative, the DHCP server will
masquerade as the IP address at broadcast address + offset.
.sp
The Windows \fBipconfig /all\fP command can be used to show what
Windows thinks the DHCP server address is. OpenVPN will \(dqclaim\(dq
this address, so make sure to use a free address. Having said that,
different OpenVPN instantiations, including different ends of
the same connection, can share the same virtual DHCP server
address.
.sp
The \fBlease\-time\fP parameter controls the lease time of the DHCP
assignment given to the TAP\-Win32 adapter, and is denoted in
seconds. Normally a very long lease time is preferred because it
prevents routes involving the TAP\-Win32 adapter from being lost
when the system goes to sleep. The default lease time is one year.
.TP
.B \fBnetsh\fP
Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the Windows
command\-line \(dqnetsh\(dq command. This method appears to work correctly
on Windows XP but not Windows 2000.
.TP
.B \fBipapi\fP
Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the Windows IP
Helper API. This approach does not have ideal semantics, though
testing has indicated that it works okay in practice. If you use
this option, it is best to leave the TCP/IP properties for the
TAP\-Win32 adapter in their default state, i.e. \(dqObtain an IP
address automatically.\(dq
.TP
.B \fBadaptive\fP (Default)
Try \fBdynamic\fP method initially and fail over to \fBnetsh\fP
if the DHCP negotiation with the TAP\-Win32 adapter does not succeed
in 20 seconds. Such failures have been known to occur when certain
third\-party firewall packages installed on the client machine block
the DHCP negotiation used by the TAP\-Win32 adapter. Note that if
the \fBnetsh\fP failover occurs, the TAP\-Win32 adapter TCP/IP
properties will be reset from DHCP to static, and this will cause
future OpenVPN startups using the \fBadaptive\fP mode to use
\fBnetsh\fP immediately, rather than trying \fBdynamic\fP first.
.sp
To \(dqunstick\(dq the \fBadaptive\fP mode from using \fBnetsh\fP,
run OpenVPN at least once using the \fBdynamic\fP mode to restore
the TAP\-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties to a DHCP configuration.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B  \-\-pause\-exit
Put up a \(dqpress any key to continue\(dq message on the console prior to
OpenVPN program exit. This option is automatically used by the Windows

right\-click explorer menu.
.TP
.B  \-\-register\-dns
Run \fBipconfig /flushdns\fP and \fBipconfig /registerdns\fP on

.sp
\fBexit\-event\fP is the name of a Windows global event object, and OpenVPN
will continuously monitor the state of this event object and exit when
it becomes signaled.
.sp
The second parameter indicates the initial state of \fBexit\-event\fP and
normally defaults to 0.
.sp
Multiple OpenVPN processes can be simultaneously executed with the same
\fBexit\-event\fP parameter. In any case, the controlling process can
signal \fBexit\-event\fP, causing all such OpenVPN processes to exit.
.sp
When executing an OpenVPN process using the \fB\-\-service\fP directive,
OpenVPN will probably not have a console window to output status/error

.TP
.B  \-\-show\-valid\-subnets
(Standalone) Show valid subnets for \fB\-\-dev tun\fP emulation. Since the
TAP\-Win32 driver exports an ethernet interface to Windows, and since TUN
devices are point\-to\-point in nature, it is necessary for the TAP\-Win32
driver to impose certain constraints on TUN endpoint address selection.
.sp
Namely, the point\-to\-point endpoints used in TUN device emulation must
be the middle two addresses of a /30 subnet (netmask 255.255.255.252).
.TP
.BI \-\-tap\-sleep \ n
Cause OpenVPN to sleep for \fBn\fP seconds immediately after the TAP\-Win32
adapter state is set to \(dqconnected\(dq.
.sp
This option is intended to be used to troubleshoot problems with the
\fB\-\-ifconfig\fP and \fB\-\-ip\-win32\fP options, and is used to give the
TAP\-Win32 adapter time to come up before Windows IP Helper API
operations are applied to it.

.BI \-\-win\-sys \ path
Set the Windows system directory pathname to use when looking for system
executables such as \fBroute.exe\fP and \fBnetsh.exe\fP\&. By default, if this

variable.
.sp
This option has changed behaviour since OpenVPN 2.3. Earlier you had to
define \fB\-\-win\-sys env\fP to use the SystemRoot environment variable,
otherwise it defaulted to \fBC:\e\eWINDOWS\fP\&. It is not needed to use
the \fBenv\fP keyword any more, and it will just be ignored. A warning is

Limit bandwidth of outgoing tunnel data to \fBn\fP bytes per second on the
TCP/UDP port. Note that this will only work if mode is set to
\fBp2p\fP\&.  If you want to limit the bandwidth in both directions, use
this option on both peers.
.sp
OpenVPN uses the following algorithm to implement traffic shaping: Given
a shaper rate of \fBn\fP bytes per second, after a datagram write of \fBb\fP
bytes is queued on the TCP/UDP port, wait a minimum of \fB(b / n)\fP
seconds before queuing the next write.
.sp
It should be noted that OpenVPN supports multiple tunnels between the
same two peers, allowing you to construct full\-speed and reduced
bandwidth tunnels at the same time, routing low\-priority data such as
off\-site backups over the reduced bandwidth tunnel, and other data over
the full\-speed tunnel.
.sp
Also note that for low bandwidth tunnels (under 1000 bytes per second),
you should probably use lower MTU values as well (see above), otherwise
the packet latency will grow so large as to trigger timeouts in the TLS
layer and TCP connections running over the tunnel.
.sp
OpenVPN allows \fBn\fP to be between 100 bytes/sec and 100 Mbytes/sec.

.sp
When OpenVPN is tunneling data from a TUN/TAP device to a remote client
over a TCP connection, it is possible that the TUN/TAP device might
produce data at a faster rate than the TCP connection can support. When
the number of output packets queued before sending to the TCP socket
reaches this limit for a given client connection, OpenVPN will start to
drop outgoing packets directed at this client.

Without this option, OpenVPN will opportunistically use DCO mode if
the config options and the running kernel supports using DCO.

Data channel offload currently requires data\-ciphers to only contain
AEAD ciphers (AES\-GCM and Chacha20\-Poly1305) and Linux with the
ovpn\-dco module.
