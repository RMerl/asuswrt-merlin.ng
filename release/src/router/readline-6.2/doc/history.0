       Many programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU  His-
       tory  library is able to keep track of those lines, associate arbitrary
       data with each line, and utilize information  from  previous  lines  in
       composing new ones.

       The  history library supports a history expansion feature that is iden-
       tical to the history expansion in bbaasshh..  This  section  describes  what
       syntax features are available.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input
       stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the  arguments  to  a
       previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
       commands quickly.

       History expansion is usually performed  immediately  after  a  complete
       line  is read.  It takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine
       which line from the history list to use during substitution.  The  sec-
       ond  is  to select portions of that line for inclusion into the current
       one.  The line selected from the history is the _e_v_e_n_t, and the portions
       of  that  line  that  are  acted upon are _w_o_r_d_s.  Various _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s are
       available to manipulate the selected words.  The line  is  broken  into
       words in the same fashion as bbaasshh does when reading input, so that sev-
       eral words that would otherwise be separated are  considered  one  word
       when  surrounded  by  quotes (see the description of hhiissttoorryy__ttookkeenniizzee(())
       below).  History expansions are introduced by  the  appearance  of  the
       history expansion character, which is !! by default.  Only backslash (\\)
       and single quotes can quote the history expansion character.

       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the  his-
       tory  list.   Unless  the reference is absolute, events are relative to
       the current position in the history list.

       !!      Start a history substitution, except when followed by  a  bbllaannkk,
              newline, = or (.
       !!_n     Refer to command line _n.
       !!--_n    Refer to the current command minus _n.
       !!!!     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.
       !!_s_t_r_i_n_g
              Refer  to the most recent command preceding the current position
              in the history list starting with _s_t_r_i_n_g.
       !!??_s_t_r_i_n_g[[??]]
              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current postition
              in  the  history  list containing _s_t_r_i_n_g.  The trailing ?? may be
              omitted if _s_t_r_i_n_g is followed immediately by a newline.
       ^^_s_t_r_i_n_g_1^^_s_t_r_i_n_g_2^^
              Quick substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing  _s_t_r_i_n_g_1
              with _s_t_r_i_n_g_2.  Equivalent to ``!!:s/_s_t_r_i_n_g_1/_s_t_r_i_n_g_2/'' (see MMoodd--
              iiffiieerrss below).
       !!##     The entire command line typed so far.

   WWoorrdd DDeessiiggnnaattoorrss
       Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.  A  ::
       separates  the event specification from the word designator.  It may be
       omitted if the word designator begins with a ^^, $$, **, --, or  %%.   Words
       are  numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being
       denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the  current  line  sepa-
       rated by single spaces.

       00 ((zzeerroo))
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
       _n      The _nth word.
       ^^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.
       $$      The last argument.
       %%      The word matched by the most recent `?_s_t_r_i_n_g?' search.
       _x--_y    A range of words; `-_y' abbreviates `0-_y'.
       **      All  of  the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for `_1_-_$'.
              It is not an error to use ** if there is just  one  word  in  the
              event; the empty string is returned in that case.
       xx**     Abbreviates _x_-_$.
       xx--     Abbreviates _x_-_$ like xx**, but omits the last word.

       If  a  word  designator is supplied without an event specification, the
       previous command is used as the event.

   MMooddiiffiieerrss
       After the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence of  one
       or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:'.

       hh      Remove a trailing file name component, leaving only the head.
       tt      Remove all leading file name components, leaving the tail.
       rr      Remove a trailing suffix of the form _._x_x_x, leaving the basename.
       ee      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       pp      Print the new command but do not execute it.
       qq      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
       xx      Quote the substituted words as with qq, but break into  words  at
              bbllaannkkss and newlines.
       ss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//
              Substitute  _n_e_w  for  the  first  occurrence of _o_l_d in the event
              line.  Any delimiter can be used  in  place  of  /.   The  final
              delimiter  is  optional if it is the last character of the event
              line.  The delimiter may be quoted in _o_l_d and _n_e_w with a  single
              backslash.   If & appears in _n_e_w, it is replaced by _o_l_d.  A sin-
              gle backslash will quote the &.  If _o_l_d is null, it  is  set  to
              the  last  _o_l_d substituted, or, if no previous history substitu-
              tions took place, the last _s_t_r_i_n_g in a !!??_s_t_r_i_n_g[[??]]  search.
       &&      Repeat the previous substitution.
       gg      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is
              used  in  conjunction  with `::ss' (e.g., `::ggss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//') or `::&&'.
              If used with `::ss', any delimiter can be used in place of /,  and
              the  final  delimiter is optional if it is the last character of
              the event line.  An aa may be used as a synonym for gg.
       GG      Apply the following `ss' modifier once to each word in the  event
              line.

       This  section  describes  how  to use the History library in other pro-

       The programmer using the History library has  available  functions  for
       remembering  lines on a history list, associating arbitrary data with a
       line, removing lines from the list, searching through the  list  for  a
       line  containing  an arbitrary text string, and referencing any line in
       the list directly.  In addition, a history _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n function is avail-
       able  which  provides  for a consistent user interface across different
       programs.

       The user using programs written with the History library has the  bene-
       fit  of  a  consistent user interface with a set of well-known commands
       for manipulating the text of previous lines and using that text in  new
       commands.  The basic history manipulation commands are identical to the
       history substitution provided by bbaasshh.

       If the programmer desires, he  can  use  the  Readline  library,  which
       includes some history manipulation by default, and has the added advan-
       tage of command line editing.

       Before declaring any functions  using  any  functionality  the  History
       library  provides  in  other code, an application writer should include
       the file  _<_r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e_/_h_i_s_t_o_r_y_._h_>  in  any  file  that  uses  the  History
       library's  features.   It  supplies  extern declarations for all of the
       library's public functions and variables, and declares all of the  pub-
       lic data structures.


   HHiissttoorryy SSttoorraaggee
       The  history  list  is an array of history entries.  A history entry is
       declared as follows:

       _t_y_p_e_d_e_f _v_o_i_d _* hhiissttddaattaa__tt;;

       typedef struct _hist_entry {
         char *line;
         char *timestamp;
         histdata_t data;
       } HIST_ENTRY;

       The history list itself might therefore be declared as

       _H_I_S_T___E_N_T_R_Y _*_* tthhee__hhiissttoorryy__lliisstt;;

       The state of the History library is encapsulated into a  single  struc-
       ture:

       /*
        * A structure used to pass around the current state of the history.
        */
       typedef struct _hist_state {
         HIST_ENTRY **entries; /* Pointer to the entries themselves. */
         int offset;           /* The location pointer within this array. */
         int length;           /* Number of elements within this array. */
         int size;             /* Number of slots allocated to this array. */
         int flags;
       } HISTORY_STATE;

       If  the flags member includes HHSS__SSTTIIFFLLEEDD, the history has been stifled.

       These functions allow searching of the history list  for  entries  con-
       taining a specific string.  Searching may be performed both forward and
       backward  from  the  current  history  position.   The  search  may  be
       _a_n_c_h_o_r_e_d,  meaning  that  the string must match at the beginning of the
       history entry.

       Search the history for _s_t_r_i_n_g, starting at the current history  offset.
       If  _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n  is  less  than  0,  then  the search is through previous
       entries, otherwise through subsequent entries.   If  _s_t_r_i_n_g  is  found,
       then  the  current  history index is set to that history entry, and the
       value returned is the offset in the line of the entry where _s_t_r_i_n_g  was
       found.  Otherwise, nothing is changed, and a -1 is returned.

       Search  the history for _s_t_r_i_n_g, starting at the current history offset.
       The search is anchored: matching lines  must  begin  with  _s_t_r_i_n_g.   If
       _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n  is less than 0, then the search is through previous entries,

       Search for _s_t_r_i_n_g in the history list, starting  at  _p_o_s,  an  absolute
       index  into  the  list.   If _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n is negative, the search proceeds

       Read a range of lines from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, adding them to the  history  list.
       Start  reading  at  line _f_r_o_m and end at _t_o.  If _f_r_o_m is zero, start at
       the beginning.  If _t_o is less than _f_r_o_m, then read until the end of the

       _i_n_t hhiissttoorryy__bbaassee
       The logical offset of the first entry in the history list.

       _i_n_t hhiissttoorryy__lleennggtthh
       The number of entries currently stored in the history list.

       _i_n_t hhiissttoorryy__mmaaxx__eennttrriieess
       The maximum number of history entries.  This must be changed using ssttii--

       If non-zero, timestamps are written to the history file, so they can be
       preserved between sessions.  The default value is 0, meaning that time-
       stamps are not saved.  The current timestamp format uses the  value  of
       _h_i_s_t_o_r_y___c_o_m_m_e_n_t___c_h_a_r  to delimit timestamp entries in the history file.
       If that variable does not have a value (the default),  timestamps  will
       not be written.

       _c_h_a_r hhiissttoorryy__eexxppaannssiioonn__cchhaarr
       The character that introduces a history event.  The default is !!.  Set-
       ting this to 0 inhibits history expansion.

       _c_h_a_r hhiissttoorryy__ssuubbsstt__cchhaarr
       The character that invokes word substitution if found at the start of a

       During  tokenization,  if this character is seen as the first character
       of a word, then it and all subsequent characters up to  a  newline  are
       ignored,  suppressing  history expansion for the remainder of the line.
       This is disabled by default.

       The  list  of  additional characters which can delimit a history search
       string, in addition to space, tab, _: and _? in the case of  a  substring
       search.  The default is empty.

       _i_n_t hhiissttoorryy__qquuootteess__iinnhhiibbiitt__eexxppaannssiioonn
       If non-zero, single-quoted words are not scanned for the history expan-
       sion character.  The default value is 0.

       This should be set to the address of a function that  takes  two  argu-
       ments:  a  cchhaarr  **  (_s_t_r_i_n_g) and an iinntt index into that string (_i).  It
       should return a non-zero value if the  history  expansion  starting  at
       _s_t_r_i_n_g_[_i_]  should  not  be  performed;  zero if the expansion should be
       done.  It is intended for use by applications like bbaasshh  that  use  the
       history  expansion character for additional purposes.  By default, this
       variable is set to NNUULLLL.
