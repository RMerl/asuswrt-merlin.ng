       rreeaaddlliinnee will read a line from the terminal and return it, using pprroommpptt
       as a prompt.  If pprroommpptt is NNUULLLL or  the  empty  string,  no  prompt  is
       issued.  The line returned is allocated with _m_a_l_l_o_c(3); the caller must
       free it when  finished.   The  line  returned  has  the  final  newline
       removed, so only the text of the line remains.

       rreeaaddlliinnee  offers  editing  capabilities  while the user is entering the
       line.  By default, the line editing commands are similar  to  those  of
       emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also available.

       This  manual  page describes only the most basic use of rreeaaddlliinnee.  Much
       more functionality is available; see _T_h_e _G_N_U _R_e_a_d_l_i_n_e _L_i_b_r_a_r_y  and  _T_h_e
       _G_N_U _H_i_s_t_o_r_y _L_i_b_r_a_r_y for additional information.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       rreeaaddlliinnee  returns  the text of the line read.  A blank line returns the
       empty string.  If EEOOFF is encountered while reading a line, and the line
       is  empty,  NNUULLLL is returned.  If an EEOOFF is read with a non-empty line,
       it is treated as a newline.

NNOOTTAATTIIOONN
       An Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.  Control keys are
       denoted  by C-_k_e_y, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Similarly, _m_e_t_a keys are
       denoted by M-_k_e_y, so M-x means Meta-X.  (On keyboards  without  a  _m_e_t_a
       key,  M-_x means ESC _x, i.e., press the Escape key then the _x key.  This
       makes ESC the _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_f_i_x.  The combination M-C-_x means  ESC-Control-_x,
       or  press the Escape key then hold the Control key while pressing the _x
       key.)

       Readline commands may be given numeric _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s, which normally act as
       a  repeat  count.   Sometimes,  however, it is the sign of the argument
       that is significant.  Passing a negative argument  to  a  command  that
       acts  in the forward direction (e.g., kkiillll--lliinnee) causes that command to
       act in a backward direction.  Commands whose  behavior  with  arguments
       deviates from this are noted.

       When  a command is described as _k_i_l_l_i_n_g text, the text deleted is saved
       for possible future retrieval (_y_a_n_k_i_n_g).  The killed text is saved in a
       _k_i_l_l _r_i_n_g.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one
       unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text
       separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.

IINNIITTIIAALLIIZZAATTIIOONN FFIILLEE
       Readline  is  customized  by putting commands in an initialization file
       (the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file).  The name of this file is taken from the  value  of
       the  IINNPPUUTTRRCC  environment  variable.   If  that  variable is unset, the
       default is _~_/_._i_n_p_u_t_r_c.  If that file  does not exist or cannot be read,
       the  ultimate  default  is _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c.  When a program which uses the
       readline library starts up, the init file is read, and the key bindings
       and  variables  are set.  There are only a few basic constructs allowed
       in the readline init file.  Blank lines are ignored.   Lines  beginning
       with  a  ## are comments.  Lines beginning with a $$ indicate conditional
       constructs.  Other lines denote key  bindings  and  variable  settings.
       Each  program using this library may add its own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument

       into the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c would make M-C-u execute the readline command  _u_n_i_v_e_r_-
       _s_a_l_-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.

       The  following symbolic character names are recognized while processing
       key bindings: _D_E_L, _E_S_C, _E_S_C_A_P_E,  _L_F_D,  _N_E_W_L_I_N_E,  _R_E_T,  _R_E_T_U_R_N,  _R_U_B_O_U_T,
       _S_P_A_C_E, _S_P_C, and _T_A_B.

       In  addition  to  command  names, readline allows keys to be bound to a
       string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a _m_a_c_r_o).


   KKeeyy BBiinnddiinnggss
       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file is  simple.
       All  that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro
       and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be  speci-
       fied in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with _M_e_t_a_- or
       _C_o_n_t_r_o_l_- prefixes, or as a key sequence.  The name and key sequence are
       separated  by a colon.  There can be no whitespace between the name and
       the colon.

       When using the form kkeeyynnaammee:_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e or _m_a_c_r_o, _k_e_y_n_a_m_e is the name
       of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "> output"

       In  the above example, _C_-_u is bound to the function uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt,
       _M_-_D_E_L is bound to the function bbaacckkwwaarrdd--kkiillll--wwoorrdd, and _C_-_o is bound  to
       run  the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the
       text ``> output'' into the line).

       In the second form, ""kkeeyysseeqq"":_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e  or  _m_a_c_r_o,  kkeeyysseeqq  differs
       from  kkeeyynnaammee above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may
       be specified by placing the sequence within double  quotes.   Some  GNU
       Emacs  style  key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but
       the symbolic character names are not recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, _C_-_u is again bound to the function uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt.
       _C_-_x  _C_-_r is bound to the function rree--rreeaadd--iinniitt--ffiillee, and _E_S_C _[ _1 _1 _~ is
       bound to insert the text ``Function Key 1''.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when  speci-
       fying key sequences is
              \\CC--    control prefix
              \\MM--    meta prefix
              \\ee     an escape character
              \\\\     backslash
              \\""     literal ", a double quote
              \\''     literal ', a single quote

       In  addition  to  the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of
       backslash escapes is available:
              \\aa     alert (bell)
              \\bb     backspace
              \\dd     delete
              \\ff     form feed
              \\nn     newline
              \\rr     carriage return
              \\tt     horizontal tab
              \\vv     vertical tab
              \\_n_n_n   the eight-bit character whose value is  the  octal  value
                     _n_n_n (one to three digits)
              \\xx_H_H   the  eight-bit  character  whose value is the hexadecimal
                     value _H_H (one or two hex digits)

       When entering the text of a macro, single or double  quotes  should  be
       used  to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to be a
       function name.  In the macro  body,  the  backslash  escapes  described
       above  are  expanded.   Backslash will quote any other character in the
       macro text, including " and '.

       BBaasshh allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or  modi-
       fied  with  the bbiinndd builtin command.  The editing mode may be switched
       during interactive use by using the --oo option to the sseett  builtin  com-
       mand.   Other  programs  using this library provide similar mechanisms.
       The _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file may be edited and re-read if a program does  not  pro-
       vide any other means to incorporate new bindings.

   VVaarriiaabblleess
       Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behav-
       ior.  A variable may be set in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file with a statement of the
       form

              sseett _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_-_n_a_m_e _v_a_l_u_e

       Except  where  noted,  readline variables can take the values OOnn or OOffff
       (without regard to case).  Unrecognized  variable  names  are  ignored.
       When  a variable value is read, empty or null values, "on" (case-insen-
       sitive), and "1" are equivalent to OOnn.  All other values are equivalent
       to OOffff.  The variables and their default values are:

       bbeellll--ssttyyllee ((aauuddiibbllee))
              Controls  what  happens when readline wants to ring the terminal
              bell.  If set to nnoonnee, readline never rings the bell.  If set to
              vviissiibbllee,  readline  uses a visible bell if one is available.  If
              set to aauuddiibbllee, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
       bbiinndd--ttttyy--ssppeecciiaall--cchhaarrss ((OOnn))
              If set to OOnn, readline attempts to bind the  control  characters
              treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver to their read-
              line equivalents.
       ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn ((````##''''))
              The string that is inserted in vvii mode when  the  iinnsseerrtt--ccoommmmeenntt
              command is executed.  This command is bound to MM--## in emacs mode
              and to ## in vi command mode.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--ddiissppllaayy--wwiiddtthh ((--11))
              The number of screen columns used to  display  possible  matches
              when  performing completion.  The value is ignored if it is less
              than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A value of  0
              will  cause  matches  to be displayed one per line.  The default
              value is -1.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--iiggnnoorree--ccaassee ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline performs filename matching and completion
              in a case-insensitive fashion.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--mmaapp--ccaassee ((OOffff))
              If  set  to  OOnn, and ccoommpplleettiioonn--iiggnnoorree--ccaassee is enabled, readline
              treats hyphens (_-) and underscores (__) as equivalent  when  per-
              forming case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--pprreeffiixx--ddiissppllaayy--lleennggtthh ((00))
              The  length in characters of the common prefix of a list of pos-
              sible completions that is displayed without modification.   When
              set  to  a  value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than
              this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying  possi-
              ble completions.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--qquueerryy--iitteemmss ((110000))
              This  determines when the user is queried about viewing the num-
              ber of possible completions generated  by  the  ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommppllee--
              ttiioonnss  command.  It may be set to any integer value greater than
              or equal to zero.  If the  number  of  possible  completions  is
              greater than or equal to the value of this variable, the user is
              asked whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise they  are
              simply listed on the terminal.  A negative value causes readline
              to never ask.
       ccoonnvveerrtt--mmeettaa ((OOnn))
              If set to OOnn, readline will convert characters with  the  eighth
              bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and
              prefixing it with an escape character (in effect,  using  escape
              as the _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_f_i_x).
       ddiissaabbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonn ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline will inhibit word completion.  Completion
              characters will be inserted into the line as if  they  had  been
              mapped to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt.
       eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee ((eemmaaccss))
              Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings sim-
              ilar to _E_m_a_c_s or _v_i.  eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee can be set to either eemmaaccss or
              vvii.
       eecchhoo--ccoonnttrrooll--cchhaarraacctteerrss ((OOnn))
              When  set to OOnn, on operating systems that indicate they support
              it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal gener-
              ated from the keyboard.
       eennaabbllee--kkeeyyppaadd ((OOffff))
              When set to OOnn, readline will try to enable the application key-
              pad when it is called.  Some systems need  this  to  enable  the
              arrow keys.
       eennaabbllee--mmeettaa--kkeeyy ((OOnn))
              When  set  to  OOnn, readline will try to enable any meta modifier
              key the terminal claims to support when it is called.   On  many
              terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters.
       eexxppaanndd--ttiillddee ((OOffff))
              If  set  to  OOnn,  tilde  expansion  is  performed  when readline
              attempts word completion.
       hhiissttoorryy--pprreesseerrvvee--ppooiinntt ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, the history code attempts to place  point  at  the
              same  location on each history line retrieved with pprreevviioouuss--hhiiss--
              ttoorryy or nneexxtt--hhiissttoorryy.
       hhiissttoorryy--ssiizzee ((00))
              Set the maximum number of history entries saved in  the  history
              list.  If set to zero, the number of entries in the history list
              is not limited.
       hhoorriizzoonnttaall--ssccrroollll--mmooddee ((OOffff))
              When set to OOnn, makes readline use a single  line  for  display,
              scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it
              becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping  to  a
              new line.
       iinnppuutt--mmeettaa ((OOffff))
              If  set to OOnn, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it
              will not clear the eighth  bit  in  the  characters  it  reads),
              regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The name
              mmeettaa--ffllaagg is a synonym for this variable.
       iisseeaarrcchh--tteerrmmiinnaattoorrss ((````CC--[[ CC--JJ''''))
              The string of characters that should  terminate  an  incremental
              search  without  subsequently  executing the character as a com-
              mand.  If this variable has not been given a value, the  charac-
              ters _E_S_C and _C_-_J will terminate an incremental search.
       kkeeyymmaapp ((eemmaaccss))
              Set  the current readline keymap.  The set of legal keymap names
              is _e_m_a_c_s_, _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_, _e_m_a_c_s_-_m_e_t_a_, _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_t_l_x_,  _v_i_,  _v_i_-_m_o_v_e_,
              _v_i_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d,  and  _v_i_-_i_n_s_e_r_t.   _v_i  is  equivalent to _v_i_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d;
              _e_m_a_c_s is equivalent to _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d.   The  default  value  is
              _e_m_a_c_s.   The  value  of  eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee  also  affects the default
              keymap.
       mmaarrkk--ddiirreeccttoorriieess ((OOnn))
              If set to OOnn, completed directory names have a slash appended.
       mmaarrkk--mmooddiiffiieedd--lliinneess ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, history lines that have  been  modified  are  dis-
              played with a preceding asterisk (**).
       mmaarrkk--ssyymmlliinnkkeedd--ddiirreeccttoorriieess ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, completed names which are symbolic links to direc-
              tories  have  a  slash  appended  (subject  to  the   value   of
              mmaarrkk--ddiirreeccttoorriieess).
       mmaattcchh--hhiiddddeenn--ffiilleess ((OOnn))
              This  variable,  when  set to OOnn, causes readline to match files
              whose names begin with a  `.'  (hidden  files)  when  performing
              filename  completion.   If  set  to OOffff, the leading `.' must be
              supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.

              If set to OOnn, menu completion displays the common prefix of  the
              list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling
              through the list.
       oouuttppuutt--mmeettaa ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline will display characters with  the  eighth
              bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
       ppaaggee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((OOnn))
              If set to OOnn, readline uses an internal _m_o_r_e-like pager to  dis-
              play a screenful of possible completions at a time.
       pprriinntt--ccoommpplleettiioonnss--hhoorriizzoonnttaallllyy ((OOffff))
              If  set  to  OOnn,  readline will display completions with matches
              sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down  the
              screen.
       rreevveerrtt--aallll--aatt--nneewwlliinnee ((OOffff))
              If  set  to  OOnn, readline will undo all changes to history lines
              before returning when aacccceepptt--lliinnee is executed.  By default, his-
              tory  lines  may  be  modified  and retain individual undo lists
              across calls to rreeaaddlliinnee.
       sshhooww--aallll--iiff--aammbbiigguuoouuss ((OOffff))
              This alters the default behavior of  the  completion  functions.
              If set to OOnn, words which have more than one possible completion
              cause the matches to be listed immediately  instead  of  ringing
              the bell.
       sshhooww--aallll--iiff--uunnmmooddiiffiieedd ((OOffff))
              This  alters the default behavior of the completion functions in
              a fashion similar to sshhooww--aallll--iiff--aammbbiigguuoouuss.  If set to OOnn, words
              which  have more than one possible completion without any possi-
              ble partial completion (the possible completions don't  share  a
              common  prefix)  cause  the  matches  to  be  listed immediately
              instead of ringing the bell.
       sskkiipp--ccoommpplleetteedd--tteexxtt ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, this alters the default completion  behavior  when
              inserting  a  single match into the line.  It's only active when
              performing completion in the middle  of  a  word.   If  enabled,
              readline  does  not  insert  characters from the completion that
              match characters after point in the  word  being  completed,  so
              portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
       vviissiibbllee--ssttaattss ((OOffff))
              If  set to OOnn, a character denoting a file's type as reported by
              _s_t_a_t(2) is appended to the filename when listing  possible  com-
              pletions.

   CCoonnddiittiioonnaall CCoonnssttrruuccttss
       Readline  implements  a  facility  similar in spirit to the conditional
       compilation features of the C preprocessor which  allows  key  bindings
       and  variable  settings  to be performed as the result of tests.  There
       are four parser directives used.

       $$iiff    The $$iiff construct allows bindings to be made based on the  edit-
              ing  mode,  the  terminal  being  used, or the application using
              readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the  line;
              no characters are required to isolate it.

              mmooddee   The  mmooddee==  form  of  the  $$iiff  directive is used to test
                     whether readline is in emacs or vi  mode.   This  may  be
                     used  in  conjunction  with  the  sseett kkeeyymmaapp command, for
                     instance, to  set  bindings  in  the  _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d  and
                     _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_t_l_x  keymaps  only  if readline is starting out in
                     emacs mode.

              tteerrmm   The tteerrmm== form may be used to  include  terminal-specific
                     key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by
                     the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side
                     of  the == is tested against the full name of the terminal
                     and the portion of the terminal name before the first  --.
                     This  allows  _s_u_n  to  match  both  _s_u_n  and _s_u_n_-_c_m_d, for
                     instance.

              aapppplliiccaattiioonn
                     The aapppplliiccaattiioonn construct is used to include application-
                     specific  settings.   Each  program  using  the  readline
                     library sets the _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _n_a_m_e, and an  initialization
                     file can test for a particular value.  This could be used
                     to bind key sequences to functions useful for a  specific
                     program.   For instance, the following command adds a key
                     sequence that quotes the  current  or  previous  word  in
                     bbaasshh:

                     $$iiff Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     $$eennddiiff

       $$eennddiiff This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an $$iiff
              command.

       $$eellssee  Commands in this branch of the $$iiff directive are executed if the
              test fails.

       $$iinncclluuddee
              This  directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads
              commands and bindings from that file.  For example, the  follow-
              ing directive would read _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c:

              $$iinncclluuddee  _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c

SSEEAARRCCHHIINNGG
       Readline  provides  commands  for searching through the command history
       for lines containing a specified string.  There are two  search  modes:
       _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l and _n_o_n_-_i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l.

       Incremental  searches  begin  before  the  user has finished typing the
       search string.  As each character of the search string is typed,  read-
       line displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed
       so far.  An incremental search requires  only  as  many  characters  as
       needed  to  find  the desired history entry.  To search backward in the
       history for a particular string, type CC--rr.  Typing CC--ss searches forward
       through  the  history.   The  characters  present  in  the value of the
       iisseeaarrcchh--tteerrmmiinnaattoorrss variable  are  used  to  terminate  an  incremental
       search.   If that variable has not been assigned a value the _E_s_c_a_p_e and
       CC--JJ characters will terminate an incremental search.  CC--GG will abort an
       incremental  search  and restore the original line.  When the search is
       terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes  the
       current line.

       To  find other matching entries in the history list, type CC--ss or CC--rr as
       appropriate.  This will search backward or forward in the  history  for
       the  next  line matching the search string typed so far.  Any other key
       sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search and exe-
       cute  that  command.  For instance, a newline will terminate the search
       and accept the line, thereby executing the  command  from  the  history
       list.  A movement command will terminate the search, make the last line
       found the current line, and begin editing.

       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before  starting
       to  search  for matching history lines.  The search string may be typed
       by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

       The following is a list of the names of the commands  and  the  default
       key sequences to which they are bound.  Command names without an accom-
       panying key sequence are unbound by default.

       In the following descriptions, _p_o_i_n_t refers to the current cursor posi-
       tion,  and  _m_a_r_k refers to a cursor position saved by the sseett--mmaarrkk com-
       mand.  The text between the point  and  mark  is  referred  to  as  the
       _r_e_g_i_o_n.

              position (the _p_o_i_n_t).  This is a non-incremental search.
       hhiissttoorryy--sseeaarrcchh--bbaacckkwwaarrdd
              Search backward through the history for the string of characters
              between  the start of the current line and the point.  This is a
              non-incremental search.
       yyaannkk--nntthh--aarrgg ((MM--CC--yy))
              Insert the first argument to the previous command  (usually  the
              second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument _n,
              insert the _nth word from the previous command (the words in  the
              previous  command  begin  with  word  0).   A  negative argument
              inserts the _nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once
              the  argument _n is computed, the argument is extracted as if the
              "!_n" history expansion had been specified.
       yyaannkk--llaasstt--aarrgg ((MM--..,, MM--__))
              Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last  word
              of the previous history entry).  With a numeric argument, behave
              exactly like yyaannkk--nntthh--aarrgg.  Successive  calls  to  yyaannkk--llaasstt--aarrgg
              move  back through the history list, inserting the last word (or
              the word specified by the argument to the first  call)  of  each
              line in turn.  Any numeric argument supplied to these successive
              calls determines the direction to move through the  history.   A
              negative  argument  switches  the  direction through the history
              (back or forward).  The history expansion facilities are used to
              extract  the last argument, as if the "!$" history expansion had
              been specified.

   CCoommmmaannddss ffoorr CChhaannggiinngg TTeexxtt
       ddeelleettee--cchhaarr ((CC--dd))
              Delete the character at point.  If point is at the beginning  of
              the  line,  there  are  no  characters in the line, and the last
              character typed was not bound to ddeelleettee--cchhaarr, then return EEOOFF.

              Delete the character behind the cursor.  When  given  a  numeric
              argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.
       ffoorrwwaarrdd--bbaacckkwwaarrdd--ddeelleettee--cchhaarr
              Delete  the  character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at
              the end of the line, in which case the character behind the cur-
              sor is deleted.
       qquuootteedd--iinnsseerrtt ((CC--qq,, CC--vv))
              Add the next character that you type to the line verbatim.  This
              is how to insert characters like CC--qq, for example.
       ttaabb--iinnsseerrtt ((MM--TTAABB))
              Insert a tab character.
       sseellff--iinnsseerrtt ((aa,, bb,, AA,, 11,, !!,, ......))
              Insert the character typed.
       ttrraannssppoossee--cchhaarrss ((CC--tt))
              Drag the character before point forward over  the  character  at
              point,  moving point forward as well.  If point is at the end of
              the line, then this transposes the two characters before  point.
              Negative arguments have no effect.
       ttrraannssppoossee--wwoorrddss ((MM--tt))
              Drag  the  word  before  point past the word after point, moving
              point over that word as well.  If point is at  the  end  of  the
              line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       uuppccaassee--wwoorrdd ((MM--uu))
              Uppercase  the  current  (or  following)  word.  With a negative
              argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       ddoowwnnccaassee--wwoorrdd ((MM--ll))
              Lowercase the current (or  following)  word.   With  a  negative
              argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       ccaappiittaalliizzee--wwoorrdd ((MM--cc))
              Capitalize  the  current  (or  following) word.  With a negative
              argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
       oovveerrwwrriittee--mmooddee
              Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric  argu-
              ment, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive
              numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects
              only  eemmaaccss mode; vvii mode does overwrite differently.  Each call
              to _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e_(_) starts in insert mode.  In overwrite mode, charac-
              ters  bound to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt replace the text at point rather than
              pushing the text  to  the  right.   Characters  bound  to  bbaacckk--
              wwaarrdd--ddeelleettee--cchhaarr  replace  the  character  before  point  with a
              space.  By default, this command is unbound.

       uunniixx--lliinnee--ddiissccaarrdd ((CC--uu))
              Kill backward from point to the  beginning  of  the  line.   The
              killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
       kkiillll--wwhhoollee--lliinnee

              is.
       kkiillll--wwoorrdd ((MM--dd))
              Kill from point the end of  the  current  word,  or  if  between
              words,  to  the  end  of the next word.  Word boundaries are the
              same as those used by ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.

              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries  are  the  same  as
              those used by bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       uunniixx--wwoorrdd--rruubboouutt ((CC--ww))
              Kill  the  word behind point, using white space as a word bound-
              ary.  The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
       uunniixx--ffiilleennaammee--rruubboouutt
              Kill the word behind point, using  white  space  and  the  slash
              character  as  the word boundaries.  The killed text is saved on
              the kill-ring.

              Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
       kkiillll--rreeggiioonn
              Kill the text between the point and  _m_a_r_k  (saved  cursor  posi-
              tion).  This text is referred to as the _r_e_g_i_o_n.
       ccooppyy--rreeggiioonn--aass--kkiillll

       ccooppyy--bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd
              Copy  the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word bound-
              aries are the same as bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       ccooppyy--ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd
              Copy the word following point to  the  kill  buffer.   The  word
              boundaries are the same as ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       yyaannkk ((CC--yy))
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       yyaannkk--ppoopp ((MM--yy))
              Rotate  the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works follow-
              ing yyaannkk or yyaannkk--ppoopp.

   NNuummeerriicc AArrgguummeennttss
       ddiiggiitt--aarrgguummeenntt ((MM--00,, MM--11,, ......,, MM----))
              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start  a
              new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
       uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt
              This  is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is
              followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading  minus
              sign,  those digits define the argument.  If the command is fol-
              lowed by digits, executing  uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt  again  ends  the
              numeric  argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case,
              if this command is immediately followed by a character  that  is
              neither  a  digit or minus sign, the argument count for the next
              command is multiplied by four.  The argument count is  initially
              one,  so  executing this function the first time makes the argu-
              ment count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen,
              and so on.

   CCoommpplleettiinngg
       ccoommpplleettee ((TTAABB))
              Attempt  to  perform  completion  on the text before point.  The
              actual completion performed is application-specific.  BBaasshh,  for
              instance,  attempts  completion  treating the text as a variable
              (if the text begins with $$), username (if the text  begins  with
              ~~),  hostname (if the text begins with @@), or command (including
              aliases and functions) in turn.  If none  of  these  produces  a
              match,  filename  completion  is  attempted.   GGddbb, on the other
              hand, allows completion of program functions and variables,  and
              only attempts filename completion under certain circumstances.
       ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((MM--??))
              List  the  possible  completions of the text before point.  When
              displaying completions, readline sets the number of columns used
              for  display to the value of ccoommpplleettiioonn--ddiissppllaayy--wwiiddtthh, the value
              of the environment variable CCOOLLUUMMNNSS, or  the  screen  width,  in
              that order.
       iinnsseerrtt--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((MM--**))
              Insert  all completions of the text before point that would have
              been generated by ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss.
       mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee
              Similar to ccoommpplleettee, but replaces the word to be completed  with
              a  single match from the list of possible completions.  Repeated
              execution of mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee steps through the  list  of  possible
              completions,  inserting  each  match in turn.  At the end of the
              list of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of
              bbeellll--ssttyyllee) and the original text is restored.  An argument of _n
              moves _n positions forward in the list  of  matches;  a  negative
              argument  may  be  used to move backward through the list.  This
              command is intended to be  bound  to  TTAABB,  but  is  unbound  by
              default.
       mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee--bbaacckkwwaarrdd
              Identical  to mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee, but moves backward through the list
              of possible completions, as if mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee had  been  given  a
              negative argument.  This command is unbound by default.
       ddeelleettee--cchhaarr--oorr--lliisstt
              Deletes  the  character under the cursor if not at the beginning
              or end of the line (like ddeelleettee--cchhaarr).  If at  the  end  of  the
              line, behaves identically to ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss.

              Read in the contents of the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file,  and  incorporate  any
              bindings or variable assignments found there.
       aabboorrtt ((CC--gg))
              Abort  the  current editing command and ring the terminal's bell

              If the metafied character _x is lowercase, run the  command  that
              is bound to the corresponding uppercase character.
       pprreeffiixx--mmeettaa ((EESSCC))
              Metafy the next character typed.  EESSCC ff is equivalent to MMeettaa--ff.
       uunnddoo ((CC--__,, CC--xx CC--uu))

       rreevveerrtt--lliinnee ((MM--rr))
              Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like executing  the
              uunnddoo  command  enough  times  to  return the line to its initial

              Swap  the  point  with the mark.  The current cursor position is
              set to the saved position, and the old cursor position is  saved

              A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of
              that character.  A negative count searches for  previous  occur-
              rences.

              A  character  is  read and point is moved to the previous occur-
              rence of that character.  A negative count searches  for  subse-
              quent occurrences.
       sskkiipp--ccssii--sseeqquueennccee
              Read  enough  characters to consume a multi-key sequence such as
              those defined for keys like Home and End.  Such sequences  begin
              with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC-[.  If this
              sequence is bound to "\[", keys producing  such  sequences  will
              have  no  effect  unless explicitly bound to a readline command,
              instead of inserting stray characters into the  editing  buffer.
              This is unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC-[.
       iinnsseerrtt--ccoommmmeenntt ((MM--##))
              Without  a  numeric  argument,  the  value  of the readline ccoomm--
              mmeenntt--bbeeggiinn variable is inserted at the beginning of the  current
              line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a
              toggle:  if the characters at the beginning of the line  do  not
              match  the value of ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn, the value is inserted, other-
              wise the characters in ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn are deleted from the begin-
              ning  of the line.  In either case, the line is accepted as if a
              newline had been typed.   The  default  value  of  ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn
              makes  the  current line a shell comment.  If a numeric argument
              causes the comment character to be removed,  the  line  will  be
              executed by the shell.
       dduummpp--ffuunnccttiioonnss
              Print  all  of the functions and their key bindings to the read-
              line output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the out-
              put  is  formatted  in such a way that it can be made part of an
              _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.
       dduummpp--vvaarriiaabblleess
              Print all of the settable variables  and  their  values  to  the
              readline  output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the
              output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an
              _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.

              Print  all of the readline key sequences bound to macros and the

              output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an
              _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.

       The following is a list of the default emacs and vi bindings.   Charac-
       ters  with  the  eighth  bit  set are written as M-<character>, and are
       referred to as _m_e_t_a_f_i_e_d characters.  The printable ASCII characters not
       mentioned  in  the  list  of  emacs  standard bindings are bound to the
       sseellff--iinnsseerrtt function, which just inserts the given character  into  the
       input line.  In vi insertion mode, all characters not specifically men-
       tioned are bound to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt.  Characters assigned to signal genera-
       tion by _s_t_t_y(1) or the terminal driver, such as C-Z or C-C, retain that
       function.  Upper and lower case metafied characters are  bound  to  the
       same  function in the emacs mode meta keymap.  The remaining characters
       are unbound, which causes readline to ring the  bell  (subject  to  the
       setting of the bbeellll--ssttyyllee variable).
