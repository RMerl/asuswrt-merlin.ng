####################### V 1.7.3.2:

corrections:
	SIGSEGV and other signals could lead to a 100% CPU loop

	Failing name resolution could lead to SIGSEGV
	Thanks to Max for reporting this issue.

	Include <stddef.h> for ptrdiff_t
	Thanks to Jeroen Roovers for reporting this issue.

	Building with --disable-sycls failed due to missing sslcls.h defines

	Socat hung when configured with --disable-sycls.

	Some minor corrections with includes etc.

	Option so-reuseport did not work. Thanks to Some Raghavendra Prabhu
	for sending a patch.

	Programs invoked with EXEC, nofork, and -u or -U had stdin and stdout
	incorrectly assigned
	Test: EXEC_NOFORK_UNIDIR
	Thanks to David Reiss for reporting this problem.

	Socat exited with status 0 even when a program invoked with SYSTEM or
	EXEC failed.
	Tests: SYSTEM_RC EXEC_RC
	Issue reported by Felix Winkelmann.

	AddressSanitizer reported a few buffer overflows (false positives).
	Nevertheless fixed Socat source.
	Issue reported by Hanno Böck.

	Socat did not use option ipv6-join-group.
	Test: USE_IPV6_JOIN_GROUP
	Thanks to Linux Lüssing for sending a patch.

	UDP-LISTEN did not honor the max-children option.
	Test: UDP4MAXCHILDREN UDP6MAXCHILDREN
	Thanks to Leander Berwers for reporting this issue.

	Options so-rcvtimeo and so-sndtimeo do not work with poll()/select()
	and therefore were useless.
	Thanks to Steve Borenstein for reporting this issue.

	Option dhparam was documented as dhparams. Added the alias name
	dhparams to fix this.
	Thanks to Alexander Neumann for sending a patch.

	Options shut-down and shut-close did not work.
	Thanks to Stefan Schimanski for providing a patch.

	There was a bug in printing readline log message caused by a misleading
	indentation.
	Thanks to Paul Wouters for reporting.

	The internal vsnprintf_r function looped or crashed on size parameter
	with hexadecimal output.

	Ignore exit code of child process when it was killed by master due to
	EOF

	Corrected byte order on read of IPV6_TCLASS value from ancillary
	message

	Fixed type of the bool element in options. This had bug caused failures
	e.g. of ignoreeof on big-endian systems when bool was not based on int.

	On systems with predefined bool type whose size differs from int some
	IPv6 and TCP options (per setsockopt()) failed.

	Length of integral data in ancillary messages varies (TOS: 1 byte,
	TTL: 4 bytes), the old implementation failed for TTL on big-endian
	hosts.

	Fixed an issue in options processing: TUN and DNS flags had failed on
	big-endian systems and the NO- forms had probable never worked.

porting:
	Type conflict between int and sig_atomic_t between declaration and
	definition of diag_immediate_type and diag_immediate_exit broke
	compilation on FreeBSD 10.1 with clang. Thanks to Emanuel Haupt for
	reporting this bug.

	Socat failed to compile on platforms with OpenSSL without
	DTLSv1_client_method or DTLSv1_server_method.
	Thanks to Simon Matter for sending a patch.

	NuttX OS headers do not provide struct ip, thus socat did not compile.
	Made struct ip subject to configure.
	Thanks to SP for reporting this issue.

	Socat failed to compile with OpenSSL version 1.0.2d where
	SSLv3_server_method and SSLv3_client_method are no longer defined.
	Thanks to Mischa ter Smitten for reporting this issue and providing
	a patch.

	configure checked for OpenSSL EC_KEY assuming it is a define but it
	is a type, thus OpenSSL ECDHE ciphers failed even on Linux.
	Thanks to Andrey Arapov for reporting this bug.

	Changes to make socat compile with OpenSSL 1.1. 
	Thanks to Sebastian Andrzej Siewior e.a. from the Debian team for
	providing the base patch.

	Thanks to Bernard Spil for providing a patch

testing:
	socks4echo.sh and socks4a-echo.sh hung with new bash with read -n

	test.sh: stderr; option -v (verbose); FDOUT_ERROR description

	improved proxy.sh - it now also takes hostnames

	A few corrections in test.sh

	DTLS1 test hangs on some distributions. Test is now only performed
	with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or higher.

docu:
	Corrected source of socat man page to correctly show man references
	like socket(2); removed obseolete entries from See Also

	Docu and some comments mentioned addresses SSL-LISTEN and SSL-CONNECT
	that do not exist (OPENSSL-LISTEN, SSL-L; and OPENNSSL-CONNECT, SSL
	are correct).
	Thanks to Zhigang Wang for reporting this issue.

	Fixed a couple of English spelling and grammar mistakes.
	Thanks to Jakub Wild for sending the patches.

	NOEXPAND() was not resolved 2 times.

	More minor docu corrections

####################### V 1.7.3.1:

security:
	Socat security advisory 8
	A stack overflow in vulnerability was found that can be triggered when
	command line arguments (complete address specifications, host names,
	file names) are longer than 512 bytes.
	Successful exploitation might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
	code with the privileges of the socat process.
	This vulnerability can only be exploited when an attacker is able to
	inject data into socat's command line.
	A vulnerable scenario would be a CGI script that reads data from clients
	and uses (parts of) this data as hostname for a Socat invocation.
	Test: NESTEDOVFL
	Credits to Takumi Akiyama for finding and reporting this issue.

	Socat security advisory 7
	MSVR-1499
	In the OpenSSL address implementation the hard coded 1024 bit DH p
	parameter was not prime. The effective cryptographic strength of a key
	exchange using these parameters was weaker than the one one could get by
	using a prime p. Moreover, since there is no indication of how these
	parameters were chosen, the existence of a trapdoor that makes possible
	for an eavesdropper to recover the shared secret from a key exchange
	that uses them cannot be ruled out.
	Futhermore, 1024bit is not considered sufficiently secure.
	Fix: generated a new 2048bit prime.
	Thanks to Santiago Zanella-Beguelin and Microsoft Vulnerability
	Research (MSVR) for finding and reporting this issue.

####################### V 1.7.3.0:

security:
	Socat security advisory 6
	CVE-2015-1379: Possible DoS with fork
	Fixed problems with signal handling caused by use of not async signal
	safe functions in signal handlers that could freeze socat, allowing
	denial of service attacks.
	Many changes in signal handling and the diagnostic messages system were
	applied to make the code async signal safe but still provide detailled
	logging from signal handlers:
	Coded function vsnprintf_r() as async signal safe incomplete substitute
	of libc vsnprintf()
	Coded function snprinterr() to replace %m in strings with a system error
	message
	Instead of gettimeofday() use clock_gettime() when available
	Pass Diagnostic messages from signal handler per unix socket to the main
	program flow
	Use sigaction() instead of signal() for better control
	Turn off nested signal handler invocations
	Thanks to Peter Lobsinger for reporting and explaining this issue.

	Red Hat issue 1019975: add TLS host name checks
	OpenSSL client checks if the server certificates names in
	extensions/subjectAltName/DNS or in subject/commonName match the name
	used to connect or the value of the openssl-commonname option.
	Test: OPENSSL_CN_CLIENT_SECURITY

	OpenSSL server checks if the client certificates names in
	extensions/subjectAltNames/DNS or subject/commonName match the value of
	the openssl-commonname option when it is used.
	Test: OPENSSL_CN_SERVER_SECURITY

	Red Hat issue 1019964: socat now uses the system certificate store with
	OPENSSL when neither options cafile nor capath are used

	Red Hat issue 1019972: needs to specify OpenSSL cipher suites
	Default cipherlist is now "HIGH:-NULL:-PSK:-aNULL" instead of empty to
	prevent downgrade attacks

new features:
	OpenSSL addresses set couple of environment variables from values in
	peer certificate, e.g.: 
	SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509_SUBJECT, SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509_ISSUER,
	SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509_COMMONNAME, 
	SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509V3_SUBJECTALTNAME_DNS
	Tests: ENV_OPENSSL_{CLIENT,SERVER}_X509_*

	Added support for methods TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, and DTLS1
	Tests: OPENSSL_METHOD_*

	Enabled OpenSSL server side use of ECDHE ciphers. Feature suggested
	by Andrey Arapov.

	Added a new option termios-rawer for ptys.
	Thanks to Christian Vogelgsang for pointing me to this requirement

corrections:
	Bind with ABSTRACT commands used non-abstract namespace (Linux).
	Test: ABSTRACT_BIND
	Thanks to Denis Shatov for reporting this bug.

	Fixed return value of nestlex()

	Option ignoreeof on the right address hung.
	Test: IGNOREEOF_REV
	Thanks to Franz Fasching for reporting this bug.

	Address SYSTEM, when terminating, shut down its parent addresses,
	e.g. an SSL connection which the parent assumed to still be active.
	Test: SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN

	Passive (listening or receiving) addresses with empty port field bound
	to a random port instead of terminating with error.
	Test: TCP4_NOPORT

	configure with some combination of disable options produced config
	files that failed to compile due to missing IPPROTO_TCP.
	Thanks to Thierry Fournier for report and patch.

	fixed a few minor bugs with OpenSSL in configure and with messages

	Socat did not work in FIPS mode because 1024 instead of 512 bit DH prime
	is required. Thanks to Zhigang Wang for reporting and sending a patch.

	Christophe Leroy provided a patch that fixes memory leaks reported by
	valgrind

	Help for filan -L was bad, is now corrected to:
	"follow symbolic links instead of showing their properties"

	Address options fdin and fdout were silently ignored when not applicable
	due to -u or -U option. Now these combinations are caught as errors.
	Test: FDOUT_ERROR
	Issue reported by Hendrik.

	Added option termios-cfmakeraw that calls cfmakeraw() and is preferred
	over option raw which is now obsolote. On SysV systems this call is
	simulated by appropriate setting.
	Thanks to Youfu Zhang for reporting issue with option raw.

porting:
	Socat included <sys/poll.h> instead of POSIX <poll.h>
	Thanks to John Spencer for reporting this issue.

	_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS; and minor changes

	Red Hat issue 1182005: socat 1.7.2.4 build failure missing
	linux/errqueue.h
	Socat failed to compile on on PPC due to new requirements for
	including <linux/errqueue.h> and a weakness in the conditional code.
	Thanks to Michel Normand for reporting this issue.

	In the man page the PTY example was badly formatted. Thanks to
	J.F.Sebastian for sending a patch.

	Added missing CVE ids to security issues in CHANGES

testing:
	Do not distribute testcert.conf with socat source but generate it
	(and new testcert6.conf) during test.sh run.

####################### V 1.7.2.4:

####################### V 1.7.2.3:

security:
	Socat security advisory 5
	CVE-2014-0019: socats PROXY-CONNECT address was vulnerable to a buffer
	overflow with data from command line (see socat-secadv5.txt)
	Credits to Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team

####################### V 1.7.2.2:

security:
	Socat security advisory 4
	CVE-2013-3571:
	after refusing a client connection due to bad source address or source
	port socat shutdown() the socket but did not close() it, resulting in
	a file descriptor leak in the listening process, visible with lsof and
	possibly resulting in EMFILE Too many open files. This issue could be
	misused for a denial of service attack.
	Full credits to Catalin Mitrofan for finding and reporting this issue.

####################### V 1.7.2.1:

security:
	Socat security advisory 3
	CVE-2012-0219:
	fixed a possible heap buffer overflow in the readline address. This bug
	could be exploited when all of the following conditions were met:
	1) one of the addresses is READLINE without the noprompt and without the
	prompt options.
	2) the other (almost arbitrary address) reads malicious data (which is
	then transferred by socat to READLINE).
	Workaround: when using the READLINE address apply option prompt or
	noprompt.
	Full credits to Johan Thillemann for finding and reporting this issue.

####################### V 1.7.2.0:

corrections:
	when UNIX-LISTEN was applied to an existing file it failed as expected
	but removed the file. Thanks to Bjoern Bosselmann for reporting this
	problem

	fixed a bug where socat might crash when connecting to a unix domain
	socket using address GOPEN. Thanks to Martin Forssen for bug report and
	patch.

	UDP-LISTEN would alway set SO_REUSEADDR even without fork option and
	when user set it to 0. Thanks to Michal Svoboda for reporting this bug.

	UNIX-CONNECT did not support half-close. Thanks to Greg Hughes who
	pointed me to that bug

	TCP-CONNECT with option nonblock reported successful connect even when
	it was still pending

	address option ioctl-intp failed with "unimplemented type 26". Thanks
	to Jeremy W. Sherman for reporting and fixing that bug

	socat option -x did not print packet direction, timestamp etc; thanks
	to Anthony Sharobaiko for sending a patch

	address PTY does not take any parameters but did not report an error
	when some were given

	Marcus Meissner provided a patch that fixes invalid output and possible
	process crash when socat prints info about an unnamed unix domain
	socket

	Michal Soltys reported the following problem and provided an initial
	patch: when socat was interrupted, e.g. by SIGSTOP, and resumed during
	data transfer only parts of the data might have been written.

	Option o-nonblock in combination with large transfer block sizes
	may result in partial writes and/or EAGAIN errors that were not handled
	properly but resulted in data loss or process termination.

	Fixed a bug that could freeze socat when during assembly of a log
	message a signal was handled that also printed a log message. socat
	development had been aware that localtime() is not thread safe but had
	only expected broken messages, not corrupted stack (glibc 2.11.1,
	Ubuntu 10.4)

	an internal store for child pids was susceptible to pid reuse which
	could lead to sporadic data loss when both fork option and exec address
	were used. Thanks to Tetsuya Sodo for reporting this problem and
	sending a patch

	OpenSSL server failed with "no shared cipher" when using cipher aNULL.
	Fixed by providing temporary DH parameters. Thanks to Philip Rowlands
	for drawing my attention to this issue.

	UDP-LISTEN slept 1s after accepting a connection. This is not required.
	Thanks to Peter Valdemar Morch for reporting this issue

	fixed a bug that could lead to error or socat crash after a client
	connection with option retry had been established

	fixed configure.in bug on net/if.h check that caused IF_NAMESIZE to be
	undefined

	improved dev_t print format definition

porting:
	Cedril Priscal ported socat to Android (using Googles cross compiler).
	The port includes the socat_buildscript_for_android.sh script

	added check for component ipi_spec_dst in struct in_pktinfo so
	compilation does not fail on Cygwin (thanks to Peter Wagemans for
	reporting this problem)

	build failed on RHEL6 due to presence of fips.h; configure now checks
	for fipsld too. Thanks to Andreas Gruenbacher for reporting this
	problem

	check for netinet6/in6.h only when IPv6 is available and enabled

	don't fail to compile when the following defines are missing:
	IPV6_PKTINFO IPV6_RTHDR IPV6_DSTOPTS IPV6_HOPOPTS IPV6_HOPLIMIT
	Thanks to Jerry Jacobs for reporting this problem (Mac OS X Lion 10.7)

	check if define __APPLE_USE_RFC_2292 helps to enable IPV6_* (MacOSX
	Lion 7.1); thanks to Jerry Jacobs to reporting this problem and
	proposing a solution

	fixed compiler warnings on Mac OS X 64bit. Thanks to Guy Harris for
	providing the patch.

	corrections for OpenEmbedded, especially termios SHIFT values and
	ISPEED/OSPEED. Thanks to John Faith for providing the patch

	minor corrections to docu and test.sh resulting from local compilation
	on Openmoko SHR

	fixed sa_family_t compile error on DragonFly. Thanks to Tony Young for
	reporting this issue and sending a patch.

	Ubuntu Oneiric: OpenSSL no longer provides SSLv2 functions; libutil.sh
	is now bsd/libutil.h; compiler warns on vars that is only written to

new features: 
	added option max-children that limits the number of concurrent child
	processes. Thanks to Sam Liddicott for providing the patch.

	Till Maas added support for tun/tap addresses without IP address
 
	added an option openssl-compress that allows to disable the compression
	feature of newer OpenSSL versions. Thanks to Michael Hanselmann for
	providing this contribution (sponsored by Google Inc.)

docu:
	minor corrections in docu (thanks to Paggas)

	client process -> child process

####################### V 1.7.1.3:

security:
	Socat security advisory 2
	CVE-2010-2799:
	fixed a stack overflow vulnerability that occurred when command
	line arguments (whole addresses, host names, file names) were longer
	than 512 bytes.
	Note that this could only be exploited when an attacker was able to
	inject data into socat's command line.
	Full credits to Felix GrÃ¶bert, Google Security Team, for finding and
	reporting this issue

####################### V 1.7.1.2:

corrections:
	user-late and group-late, when applied to a pty, affected the system
	device /dev/ptmx instead of the pty (thanks to Matthew Cloke for
	pointing me to this bug)

	socats openssl addresses failed with "nonblocking operation did not
	complete" when the peer performed a renegotiation. Thanks to Benjamin
	Delpy for reporting this bug.

	info message during socks connect showed bad port number on little
	endian systems due to wrong byte order (thanks to Peter M. Galbavy for
	bug report and patch)

	Debian bug 531078: socat execs children with SIGCHLD ignored; corrected
	to default. Thanks to Martin Dorey for reporting this bug.

porting:
	building socat on systems that predefined the CFLAGS environment to
	contain -Wall failed (esp.RedHat). Thanks to Paul Wouters for reporting
	this problem and to Simon Matter for providing the patch

	support for Solaris 8 and Sun Studio support (thanks to Sebastian
	Kayser for providing the patches)

	on some 64bit systems a compiler warning "cast from pointer to integer
	of different size" was issued on some option definitions

	added struct sockaddr_ll to union sockaddr_union to avoid "strict
	aliasing" warnings (problem reported by Paul Wouters)

docu:
	minor corrections in docu

####################### V 1.7.1.1:

corrections:
	corrected the "fixed possible SIGSEGV" fix because SIGSEGV still might
	occur under those conditions. Thanks to Toni Mattila for first
	reporting this problem.

	ftruncate64 cut its argument to 32 bits on systems with 32 bit long type

	socat crashed on systems without setenv() (esp. SunOS up to Solaris 9);
	thanks to Todd Stansell for reporting this bug

	with unidirectional EXEC and SYSTEM a close() operation was performed
	on a random number which could result in hanging e.a.

	fixed a compile problem caused by size_t/socklen_t mismatch on 64bit
	systems

	docu mentioned option so-bindtodev but correct name is so-bindtodevice. 
	Thanks to Jim Zimmerman for reporting.

docu changes:
	added environment variables example to doc/socat-multicast.html

####################### V 1.7.1.0:

new features:
	address options shut-none, shut-down, and shut-close allow to control
	socat's half close behaviour

	with address option shut-null socat sends an empty packet to the peer
	to indicate EOF

	option null-eof changes the behaviour of sockets that receive an empty
	packet to see EOF instead of ignoring it

	introduced option names substuser-early and su-e, currently equivalent
	to option substuser (thanks to Mike Perry for providing the patch)

corrections:
	fixed some typos and improved some comments

####################### V 1.7.0.1:

corrections:
	fixed possible SIGSEGV in listening addresses when a new connection was
	reset by peer before the socket addresses could be retrieved. Thanks to
	Mike Perry for sending a patch.

	fixed a bug, introduced with version 1.7.0.0, that let client
	connections with option connect-timeout fail when the connections
	succeeded. Thanks to Bruno De Fraine for reporting this bug.

	option end-close "did not apply" to addresses PTY, SOCKET-CONNECT,
	and most UNIX-* and ABSTRACT-*

	half close of EXEC and SYSTEM addresses did not work for pipes and
	sometimes socketpair

	help displayed for some option a wrong type

	under some circumstances shutdown was called multiple times for the
	same fd

####################### V 1.7.0.0:

new features:
	new address types SCTP-CONNECT and SCTP-LISTEN implement SCTP stream
	mode for IPv4 and IPv6; new address options sctp-maxseg and
	sctp-nodelay (suggested by David A. Madore; thanks to Jonathan Brannan
	for providing an initial patch)

	new address "INTERFACE" for transparent network interface handling
	(suggested by Stuart Nicholson)

	added generic socket addresses: SOCKET-CONNECT, SOCKET-LISTEN,
	SOCKET-SENDTO, SOCKET-RECVFROM, SOCKET-RECV, SOCKET-DATAGRAM allow
	protocol independent socket handling; all parameters are explicitely
	specified as numbers or hex data

	added address options ioctl-void, ioctl-int, ioctl-intp, ioctl-string,
	ioctl-bin for generic ioctl() calls.

	added address options setsockopt-int, setsockopt-bin, and
	setsockopt-string for generic setsockopt() calls

	option so-type now only affects the socket() and socketpair() calls,
	not the name resolution. so-type and so-prototype can now be applied to
	all socket based addresses.

	new address option "escape" allows to break a socat instance even when
	raw terminal mode prevents ^C etc. (feature suggested by Guido Trotter)

	socat sets environment variables SOCAT_VERSION, SOCAT_PID, SOCAT_PPID
	for use in executed scripts

	socat sets environment variables SOCAT_SOCKADDR, SOCAT_SOCKPORT,
	SOCAT_PEERADDR, SOCAT_PEERPORT in LISTEN type addresses (feature
	suggested by Ed Sawicki)

	socat receives all ancillary messages with each received packet on
	datagram related addresses. The messages are logged in raw form with
	debug level, and broken down with info level. note: each type of
	ancillary message must be enabled by appropriate address options. 

	socat provides the contents of ancillary messages received on RECVFROM
	addresses in appropriate environment variables:
	SOCAT_TIMESTAMP, SOCAT_IP_DSTADDR, SOCAT_IP_IF, SOCAT_IP_LOCADDR,
	SOCAT_IP_OPTIONS, SOCAT_IP_TOS, SOCAT_IP_TTL, SOCAT_IPV6_DSTADDR,
	SOCAT_IPV6_HOPLIMIT, SOCAT_IPV6_TCLASS

	the following address options were added to enable ancillary messages:

	patch)

corrections:
	some raw IP and UNIX datagram modes failed on BSD systems

	when UDP-LISTEN continued to listen after packet dropped by, e.g.,
	range option, the old listen socket would not be closed but a new one
	created. open sockets could accumulate.

	there was a bug in ip*-recv with bind option: it did not bind, and
	with the first received packet an error occurred:
	socket_init(): unknown address family 0
	test: RAWIP4RECVBIND

	RECVFROM addresses with FORK option hung after processing the first
	packet. test: UDP4RECVFROM_FORK

	(thanks to Jonathan Brannan e.a. for providing a patch)

	EXEC and SYSTEM with stderr injected socat messages into the data
	stream. test: EXECSTDERRLOG

	when the EXEC address got a string with consecutive spaces it created
	additional empty arguments (thanks to Olivier Hervieu for reporting
	this bug). test: EXECSPACES

	in ignoreeof polling mode socat also blocked data transfer in the other
	direction during the 1s wait intervalls (thanks to Jorgen Cederlof for
	reporting this bug)

	PROBLEM: despite to option NONBLOCK, the connect() call blocked
	SOLVED: option NONBLOCK is now applied in phase FD instead of LATE

	PROBLEM: UNLINK options issued error when file did not exist,
		terminating socat
	SOLVED: failure of unlink() is only warning if errno==ENOENT
