label(DESCRIPTION)
manpagedescription()

Socat() is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte
streams and transfers data between them. Because the streams can be constructed
from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources 
(see link(address types)(ADDRESS_TYPES)), and because lots of
link(address options)(ADDRESS_OPTIONS) may be applied to the streams, socat can
be used for many different purposes. 

Filan() is a utility that prints information about its active file
descriptors to stdout. It has been written for debugging socat(), but might be
useful for other purposes too. Use the -h option to find more infos.

Procan() is a utility that prints information about process parameters to
stdout. It has been written to better understand 
some UNIX process properties and for debugging socat(), but might be 
useful for other purposes too.

The life cycle of a socat() instance typically consists of four phases.

In the em(init) phase, the command line options are parsed and logging is
initialized. 

During the em(open) phase, socat() opens the first address and afterwards the
second address. These steps are usually blocking; thus, especially for complex address types like socks,
connection requests or authentication dialogs must be completed before the next
step is started.

In the em(transfer) phase, socat() watches both streams' read and write file
descriptors via code(select()), and, when data is available on one side em(and)
can be written to the other side, socat reads it, performs newline
character conversions if required, and writes the data to the write file
descriptor of the other stream, then continues waiting for more data in both
directions.

When one of the streams effectively reaches EOF, the em(closing) phase
begins. Socat() transfers the EOF condition to the other stream,
i.e. tries to shutdown only its write stream, giving it a chance to
terminate gracefully. For a defined time socat() continues to transfer data in
the other direction, but then closes all remaining channels and terminates.


label(OPTIONS)
manpageoptions()

Socat() provides some command line options that modify the behaviour of the
program. They have nothing to do with so called
link(address options)(ADDRESS_OPTIONS) that are used as parts of link(address specifications)(ADDRESS_SPECIFICATIONS).

startdit()
dit(bf(tt(-V)))
   Print version and available feature information to stdout, and exit.
dit(bf(tt(-h | -?)))
   Print a help text to stdout describing command line options and available address
   types, and exit.
dit(bf(tt(-hh | -??)))
   Like -h, plus a list of the short names of all available address options. Some options are
   platform dependend, so this output is helpful for checking the particular
   implementation. 
dit(bf(tt(-hhh | -???)))
   Like -hh, plus a list of all available address option names.
label(option_d)dit(bf(tt(-d)))
   Without this option, only fatal and error messages are generated; applying
   this option also prints warning messages. See link(DIAGNOSTICS)(DIAGNOSTICS)
   for more information. 
label(option_d_d)dit(bf(tt(-d -d))) Prints fatal, error, warning, and notice messages.
dit(bf(tt(-d -d -d))) Prints fatal, error, warning, notice, and info messages.
dit(bf(tt(-d -d -d -d))) Prints fatal, error, warning, notice, info, and debug
   messages. 
dit(bf(tt(-D)))
   Logs information about file descriptors before starting the transfer phase.
dit(bf(tt(-ly[<facility>])))
   Writes messages to syslog instead of stderr; severity as defined with -d
   option. With optional link(<facility>)(TYPE_FACILITY), the syslog type can
   be selected, default is "daemon". Third party libraries might not obey this
   option.
dit(bf(tt(-lf))tt( <logfile>))
   Writes messages to <logfile> [link(filename)(TYPE_FILENAME)] instead of
   stderr. Some third party libraries, in particular libwrap, might not obey
   this option.
dit(bf(tt(-ls)))
   Writes messages to stderr (this is the default). Some third party libraries 
   might not obey this option, in particular libwrap appears to only log to
   syslog. 
label(option_lp)dit(bf(tt(-lp))tt(<progname>))
   Overrides the program name printed in error messages and used for
   constructing environment variable names.
dit(bf(tt(-lu)))
   Extends the timestamp of error messages to microsecond resolution. Does not
   work when logging to syslog.
label(option_lm)dit(bf(tt(-lm[<facility>])))
   Mixed log mode. During startup messages are printed to stderr; when socat() 
   starts the transfer phase loop or daemon mode (i.e. after opening all
   streams and before starting data transfer, or, with listening sockets with
   fork option, before the first accept call), it switches logging to syslog. 
   With optional link(<facility>)(TYPE_FACILITY), the syslog type can be
   selected, default is "daemon". 
label(option_lh)dit(bf(tt(-lh)))
   Adds hostname to log messages. Uses the value from environment variable
   HOSTNAME or the value retrieved with tt(uname()) if HOSTNAME is not set.
dit(bf(tt(-v)))
   Writes the transferred data not only to their target streams, but also to
   stderr. The output format is text with some conversions for readability, and
   prefixed with "> " or "< " indicating flow directions.
dit(bf(tt(-x)))
   Writes the transferred data not only to their target streams, but also to
   stderr. The output format is hexadecimal, prefixed with "> " or "< "
   indicating flow directions. Can be combined with code(-v).
label(option_b)dit(bf(tt(-b))tt(<size>))
   Sets the data transfer block <size> [link(size_t)(TYPE_SIZE_T)].
   At most <size> bytes are transferred per step. Default is 8192 bytes. 
label(option_s)dit(bf(tt(-s)))
   By default, socat() terminates when an error occurred to prevent the process
   from running when some option could not be applied. With this
   option, socat() is sloppy with errors and tries to continue. Even with this
   option, socat will exit on fatals, and will abort connection attempts when
   security checks failed.
label(option_t)dit(bf(tt(-t))tt(<timeout>))
   When one channel has reached EOF, the write part of the other channel is shut
   down. Then, socat() waits <timeout> [link(timeval)(TYPE_TIMEVAL)] seconds
   before terminating. Default is 0.5 seconds. This timeout only applies to
   addresses where write and read part can be closed independently. When during
   the timeout interval the read part gives EOF, socat terminates without
   awaiting the timeout.
label(option_T)dit(bf(tt(-T))tt(<timeout>))
   Total inactivity timeout: when socat is already in the transfer loop and
   nothing has happened for <timeout> [link(timeval)(TYPE_TIMEVAL)] seconds
   (no data arrived, no interrupt occurred...) then it terminates.
   Useful with protocols like UDP that cannot transfer EOF.
label(option_u)dit(bf(tt(-u)))
   Uses unidirectional mode. The first address is only used for reading, and the
   second address is only used for writing (link(example)(EXAMPLE_option_u)). 
label(option_U)dit(bf(tt(-U)))
   Uses unidirectional mode in reverse direction. The first address is only
   used for writing, and the second address is only used for reading. 
label(option_g)dit(bf(tt(-g)))
   During address option parsing, don't check if the option is considered
   useful in the given address environment. Use it if you want to force, e.g.,
   appliance of a socket option to a serial device.
label(option_L)dit(bf(tt(-L))tt(<lockfile>))
   If lockfile exists, exits with error. If lockfile does not exist, creates it
   and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.
label(option_W)dit(bf(tt(-W))tt(<lockfile>))
   If lockfile exists, waits until it disappears. When lockfile does not exist,
   creates it and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.
label(option_4)dit(bf(tt(-4)))
   Use IP version 4 in case that the addresses do not implicitly or explicitly
   specify a version; this is the default.
label(option_6)dit(bf(tt(-6)))
   Use IP version 6 in case that the addresses do not implicitly or explicitly
   specify a version.
enddit()


label(ADDRESS_SPECIFICATIONS)
manpagesection(ADDRESS SPECIFICATIONS)

With the address command line arguments, the user gives socat() instructions and
the necessary information for establishing the byte streams. 

An address specification usually consists of an address type
keyword, zero or more required address parameters separated by ':' from the keyword and
from each 
other, and zero or more address options separated by ','. 

The keyword specifies the address type (e.g., TCP4, OPEN, EXEC). For some
keywords there exist synonyms ('-' for STDIO, TCP for TCP4). Keywords are case
insensitive.
For a few special address types, the keyword may be omitted:
Address specifications starting with a number are assumed to be FD (raw file
descriptor) addresses; 
if a '/' is found before the first ':' or ',', GOPEN (generic file open) is
assumed. 

The required number and type of address parameters depend on the address
type. E.g., TCP4 requires a server specification (name or address), and a port
specification (number or service name). 

Zero or more address options may be given with each address. They influence the
address in some ways. 
Options consist of an option keyword or an option keyword and a value,
separated by '='. Option keywords are case insensitive.
For filtering the options that are useful with an address
type, each option is member of one option group. For
each address type there is a set of option groups allowed. Only options
belonging to one of these address groups may be used (except with link(option -g)(option_g)). 

label(ADDRESS_DUAL)
Address specifications following the above schema are also called em(single)
address specifications.
Two single addresses can be combined with "!!" to form a em(dual) type
address for one channel. Here, the first address is used by socat() for reading
data, and the 
second address for writing data. There is no way to specify an option only once
for being applied to both single addresses.

Usually, addresses are opened in read/write
mode. When an address is part of a dual address specification, or when
link(option -u)(option_u) or link(-U)(option_U) is used, an address might be
used only for reading or for writing. Considering this is important with some
address types.

With socat version 1.5.0 and higher, the lexical analysis tries to handle
quotes and parenthesis meaningfully and allows escaping of special characters. 
If one of the characters ( { [ ' is found, the corresponding closing 
character - ) } ] ' - is looked for; they may also be nested. Within these
constructs, socats special characters and strings : , !! are not handled
specially. All those characters and strings can be escaped with \ or within ""

label(ADDRESS_TYPES)
manpagesection(ADDRESS TYPES)

This section describes the available address types with their keywords,
parameters, and semantics.

startdit()
label(ADDRESS_CREAT)dit(bf(tt(CREATE:<filename>)))
   Opens link(<filename>)(TYPE_FILENAME) with code(creat()) and uses the file
   descriptor for writing. 
   This address type requires write-only context, because a file opened with
   code(creat) cannot be read from. nl()
   Flags like O_LARGEFILE cannot be applied. If you need them use
   link(OPEN)(ADDRESS_OPEN) with options
   link(create)(OPTION_O_CREAT),link(create)(OPTION_O_TRUNC). nl()
   <filename> must be a valid existing or not existing path.
   If <filename> is a named pipe, code(creat()) might block;
   if <filename> refers to a socket, this is an error.nl() 
   Option groups: link(FD)(GROUP_FD),link(REG)(GROUP_REG),link(NAMED)(GROUP_NAMED) nl()
   Useful options:
   link(mode)(OPTION_MODE),
   link(user)(OPTION_USER),
   link(group)(OPTION_GROUP),
   link(unlink-early)(OPTION_UNLINK_EARLY),
   link(unlink-late)(OPTION_UNLINK_LATE),
   link(append)(OPTION_APPEND)nl()
   See also: link(OPEN)(ADDRESS_OPEN), link(GOPEN)(ADDRESS_GOPEN)
label(ADDRESS_EXEC)dit(bf(tt(EXEC:<command-line>)))
   Forks a sub process that establishes communication with its parent process
   and invokes the specified program with code(execvp()).
   link(<command-line>)(TYPE_COMMAND_LINE) is a simple command
   with arguments separated by single spaces. If the program name
   contains a '/', the part after the last '/' is taken as ARGV[0]. If the
   program name is a relative 
   path, the code(execvp()) semantics for finding the program via
   code($PATH) 
   apply. After successful program start, socat() writes data to stdin of the
   process and reads from its stdout using a unixdomain() socket generated by
   code(socketpair()) per default. (link(example)(EXAMPLE_ADDRESS_EXEC)) nl()  
   Option groups: link(FD)(GROUP_FD),link(SOCKET)(GROUP_SOCKET),link(EXEC)(GROUP_EXEC),link(FORK)(GROUP_FORK),link(TERMIOS)(GROUP_TERMIOS) nl()

label(ADDRESS_GOPEN)dit(bf(tt(GOPEN:<filename>)))
   (Generic open) This address type tries to handle any file system entry
   except directories usefully. link(<filename>)(TYPE_FILENAME) may be a
   relative or absolute path. If it already exists, its type is checked. 
   In case of a unixdomain() socket, socat() connects; if connecting fails,
   socat() assumes a datagram socket and uses code(sendto()) calls.
   If the entry is not a socket, socat() opens it applying the code(O_APPEND)
   flag. 
   If it does not exist, it is opened with flag
   code(O_CREAT) as a regular file (link(example)(EXAMPLE_ADDRESS_GOPEN)).nl()

label(ADDRESS_IP_SENDTO)dit(bf(tt(IP-SENDTO:<host>:<protocol>)))
   Opens a raw IP socket. Depending on host specification or option link(pf)(OPTION_PROTOCOL_FAMILY), IP protocol version
   4 or 6 is used. It uses link(<protocol>)(TYPE_PROTOCOL) to send packets
   to <host> [link(IP address)(TYPE_IP_ADDRESS)] and receives packets from
   host, ignores packets from other hosts. 
   Protocol 255 uses the raw socket with the IP header being part of the

label(ADDRESS_IP_DATAGRAM)dit(bf(tt(IP-DATAGRAM:<address>:<protocol>)))
   Sends outgoing data to the specified address which may in particular be a
   broadcast or multicast address. Packets arriving on the local socket are
   checked if their source addresses match

label(ADDRESS_IP_RECVFROM)dit(bf(tt(IP-RECVFROM:<protocol>)))
   Opens a raw IP socket of link(<protocol>)(TYPE_PROTOCOL). Depending on option link(pf)(OPTION_PROTOCOL_FAMILY), IP protocol version
   4 or 6 is used. It receives one packet from an unspecified peer and may send one or more answer packets to that peer.
   This mode is particularly useful with fork option where each arriving packet - from arbitrary peers - is handled by its own sub process.
   This allows a behaviour similar to typical UDP based servers like ntpd or
   named.nl()
   Please note that the reply packets might be fetched as incoming traffic when
   sender and receiver IP address are identical because there is no port number

label(ADDRESS_OPTIONS)
manpagesection(ADDRESS OPTIONS)

Address options can be applied to address specifications to influence the
process of opening the addresses and the 
properties of the resulting data channels. 

For technical reasons not every option can be
applied to every address type; e.g., applying a socket option to a regular file
will fail. To catch most useless combinations as early as in the open phase,
the concept of em(option groups) was introduced. Each option belongs to one
or more option groups. Options can be used only with address types that support
at least one of their option groups (but see link(option -g)(option_g)).

Address options have data types that their values must conform to. 
Every address option consists of just a keyword or a keyword followed by
"=value", where value must conform to the options type.
COMMENT(Options that trigger a call with
trivial parameters are described with type BOOL which might be misleading.)
Some address options manipulate parameters of system calls;
e.g., option sync sets the code(O_SYNC) flag with the code(open()) call. 
Other options cause a system or library call; e.g., with option `ttl=value'
the code(setsockopt(fd, SOL_IP, IP_TTL, value, sizeof(int))) call is applied.
Other
options set internal socat() variables that are used during data transfer;
e.g., `crnl' causes explicit character conversions. 
A few options have more complex implementations; e.g., su-d
(substuser-delayed) inquires some user and group infos, stores them, and
applies them later after a possible code(chroot()) call.

If multiple options are given to an address, their sequence in the address specification has (almost) no
effect on the sequence of their execution/application. Instead, socat() has
built in an em(option phase) model that tries to bring the options in a useful
order. Some options exist in different forms (e.g., 
unlink, unlink-early, unlink-late) to control the time of their execution.

If the same option is specified more than once within one address
specification, with equal or different values, the effect depends on the kind of option. Options
resulting in function calls like code(setsockopt()) cause multiple
invocations. With options that set parameters for a required call like
code(open()) 
or set internal flags, the value of the last option occurrence is effective.

The existence or semantics of many options are system dependent. Socat()
usually does NOT try to emulate missing libc or kernel features, it just
provides an 
interface to the underlying system. So, if an operating system lacks a feature,
the related option is simply not available on this platform.

The following paragraphs introduce just the more common address options. For
a more comprehensive reference and to find information about canonical option
names, alias names, option phases, and platforms see file file(xio.help).

label(GROUP_FD)em(bf(FD option group))

This option group contains options that are applied to a unix()
style file descriptor, no matter how it was generated.
Because all current socat() address types are file descriptor based, these
options may be applied to any address. nl()
Note: Some of these options are also member of another option group, that
provides another, non-fd based mechanism.
For these options, it depends on the actual address type and its option groups 
which mechanism is used. The second, non-fd based mechanism is prioritized.

label(OPTION_CLOEXEC)dit(bf(tt(cloexec=<bool>)))
   Sets the code(FD_CLOEXEC) flag with the code(fcntl()) system call to value
   link(<bool>)(TYPE_BOOL). If set,
   the file descriptor is closed on code(exec()) family function calls. Socat()
   internally handles 
   this flag for the fds it controls, so in most cases there will be no need to

   Tries to set a discretionary write lock to the whole file using the code(fcntl(fd,
   F_SETLK, ...)) system call. If the file is already locked, this call results
   in an error. 
   On Linux, when the file permissions for group are "S" (g-x,g+s), and the
   file system is locally mounted with the "mand" option, the lock is
   mandatory, i.e. prevents other processes from opening the file.
label(OPTION_SETLKW_WR)dit(bf(tt(setlkw)))
   Tries to set a discretionary waiting write lock to the whole file using the
   code(fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, ...)) system call. If the file is already locked,
   this call blocks. 
   See option link(setlk)(OPTION_SETLK_WR) for information about making this
   lock mandatory. 
label(OPTION_SETLK_RD)dit(bf(tt(setlk-rd)))
   Tries to set a discretionary read lock to the whole file using the code(fcntl(fd,
   F_SETLK, ...)) system call. If the file is already write locked, this call
   results in an error. 
   See option link(setlk)(OPTION_SETLK_WR) for information about making this
   lock mandatory. 
label(OPTION_SETLKW_RD)dit(bf(tt(setlkw-rd)))
   Tries to set a discretionary waiting read lock to the whole file using the
   code(fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, ...)) system call. If the file is already write
   locked, this call blocks. 
   See option link(setlk)(OPTION_SETLK_WR) for information about making this
   lock mandatory. 
label(OPTION_FLOCK_EX)dit(bf(tt(flock-ex)))
   Tries to set a blocking exclusive advisory lock to the file using the
   code(flock(fd, LOCK_EX)) system call. Socat() hangs in this call if the file
   is locked by another process.
label(OPTION_FLOCK_EX_NB)dit(bf(tt(flock-ex-nb)))
   Tries to set a nonblocking exclusive advisory lock to the file using the
   code(flock(fd, LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)) system call. If the file is already locked,
   this option results in an error.
label(OPTION_FLOCK_SH)dit(bf(tt(flock-sh)))
   Tries to set a blocking shared advisory lock to the file using the
   code(flock(fd, LOCK_SH)) system call. Socat() hangs in this call if the file
   is locked by another process.
label(OPTION_FLOCK_SH_NB)dit(bf(tt(flock-sh-nb)))
   Tries to set a nonblocking shared advisory lock to the file using the
   code(flock(fd, LOCK_SH|LOCK_NB)) system call. If the file is already locked,
   this option results in an error.
label(OPTION_LOCK)dit(bf(tt(lock)))
   Sets a blocking lock on the file. Uses the setlk or flock mechanism
   depending on availability on the particular platform. If both are available,
   the POSIX variant (setlkw) is used.
label(OPTION_USER)dit(bf(tt(user=<user>)))
   Sets the link(<user>)(TYPE_USER) (owner) of the stream.
   If the address is member of the NAMED option group,
   socat() uses the code(chown()) system call after opening the
   file or binding to the unixdomain() socket (race condition!).
   Without filesystem entry, socat() sets the user of the stream 
   using the code(fchown()) system call.
   These calls might require root privilege. 
label(OPTION_USER_LATE)dit(bf(tt(user-late=<user>)))
   Sets the owner of the fd to link(<user>)(TYPE_USER) with the code(fchown())
   system call after opening 
   or connecting the channel.
   This is useful only on file system entries.
label(OPTION_GROUP)dit(bf(tt(group=<group>)))
   Sets the link(<group>)(TYPE_GROUP) of the stream.
   If the address is member of the NAMED option group,
   socat() uses the code(chown()) system call after opening the
   file or binding to the unixdomain() socket (race condition!).
   Without filesystem entry, socat() sets the group of the stream 
   with the code(fchown()) system call. 
   These calls might require group membership or root privilege. 
label(OPTION_GROUP_LATE)dit(bf(tt(group-late=<group>)))
   Sets the group of the fd to link(<group>)(TYPE_GROUP) with the
   code(fchown()) system call after opening 
   or connecting the channel.
   This is useful only on file system entries. 
label(OPTION_MODE)dit(bf(tt(mode=<mode>)))
   Sets the <mode> [link(mode_t)(TYPE_MODE_T)] (permissions) of the stream.
   If the address is member of the NAMED option group and
   uses the code(open()) or code(creat()) call, the mode is applied with these.
   If the address is member of the NAMED option group without using these
   system calls, socat() uses the code(chmod()) system call after opening the
   filesystem entry or binding to the unixdomain() socket (race condition!).
   Otherwise, socat() sets the mode of the stream
   using code(fchmod()). 
   These calls might require ownership or root privilege.
label(OPTION_PERM_LATE)dit(bf(tt(perm-late=<mode>)))
   Sets the permissions of the fd to value <mode>
   [link(mode_t)(TYPE_MODE_T)] using the code(fchmod()) system call after
   opening or connecting the channel.
   This is useful only on file system entries. 
label(OPTION_APPEND)dit(bf(tt(append=<bool>)))
   Always writes data to the actual end of file.
   If the address is member of the OPEN option group, 
   socat() uses the code(O_APPEND) flag with the code(open()) system call
   (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_APPEND)).
   Otherwise, socat() applies the code(fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_APPEND)) call.
label(OPTION_NONBLOCK)dit(bf(tt(nonblock=<bool>)))
   Tries to open or use file in nonblocking mode. Its only effects are that the
   code(connect()) call of TCP addresses does not block, and that opening a
   named pipe for reading does not block.
   If the address is member of the OPEN option group,
   socat() uses the code(O_NONBLOCK) flag with the code(open()) system call.
   Otherwise, socat() applies the code(fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)) call.
COMMENT(label(OPTION_NDELAY)dit(bf(tt(ndelay=<bool>)))
   Tries to open or use file in nonblocking mode. Has no effect because socat()
   works with code(select()).) 
COMMENT(label(OPTION_ASYNC)dit(bf(tt(async=<bool>)))
   Enables SIGIO for this fd. Has no effect, because socat() ignores SIGIO.)
label(OPTION_O_BINARY)dit(bf(tt(binary)))
   Opens the file in binary mode to avoid implicit line terminator
   conversions (Cygwin).
label(OPTION_O_TEXT)dit(bf(tt(text)))
   Opens the file in text mode to force implicit line terminator conversions
   (Cygwin).
label(OPTION_O_NOINHERIT)dit(bf(tt(noinherit)))
   Does not keep this file open in a spawned process (Cygwin).
label(OPTION_COOL_WRITE)dit(bf(tt(cool-write)))
   Takes it easy when write fails with EPIPE or ECONNRESET and logs the message
   with em(notice) level instead of em(error).
   This prevents the log file from being filled with useless error messages
   when socat is used as a high volume server or proxy where clients often
   abort the connection.nl()
   This option is experimental.
label(OPTION_END_CLOSE)dit(bf(tt(end-close)))
   Changes the (address dependent) method of ending a connection to just close
   the file descriptors. This is useful when the connection is to be reused by
   or shared with other processes (link(example)(EXAMPLE_END_CLOSE)).nl()
   Normally, socket connections will be ended with tt(shutdown(2)) which
   terminates the socket even if it is shared by multiple processes. 
   tt(close(2)) "unlinks" the socket from the process but keeps it active as
   long as there are still links from other processes.nl()
   Similarly, when an address of type EXEC or SYSTEM is ended, socat usually
   will explicitly kill the sub process. With this option, it will just close
   the file descriptors.
label(OPTION_SHUT_NONE)dit(bf(tt(shut-none)))
   Changes the (address dependent) method of shutting down the write part of a
   connection to not do anything.
label(OPTION_SHUT_DOWN)dit(bf(tt(shut-down)))
   Changes the (address dependent) method of shutting down the write part of a
   connection to NOEXPAND(shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR)). Is only useful with sockets.
label(OPTION_SHUT_CLOSE)dit(bf(tt(shut-close)))
   Changes the (address dependent) method of shutting down the write part of a
   connection to NOEXPAND(close(fd)).
label(OPTION_SHUT_NULL)dit(bf(tt(shut-null)))
   When one address indicates EOF, socat() will send a zero sized packet to the
   write channel of the other address to transfer the EOF condition. This is
   useful with UDP and other datagram protocols. Has been tested against
   netcat and socat with option link(null-eof)(OPTION_NULL_EOF).
label(OPTION_NULL_EOF)dit(bf(tt(null-eof)))
   Normally socat() will ignore empty (zero size payload) packets arriving on
   datagram sockets, so it survives port scans. With this option socat()
   interprets empty datagram packets as EOF indicator (see
   link(shut-null)(OPTION_SHUT_NULL)).
label(OPTION_IOCTL_VOID)dit(bf(tt(ioctl-void=<request>)))
   Calls tt(ioctl()) with the request value as second argument and NULL as
   third argument. This option allows utilizing ioctls that are not
   explicitly implemented in socat.
label(OPTION_IOCTL_INT)dit(bf(tt(ioctl-int=<request>:<value>)))
   Calls tt(ioctl()) with the request value as second argument and the integer
   value as third argument.
label(OPTION_IOCTL_INTP)dit(bf(tt(ioctl-intp=<request>:<value>)))
   Calls tt(ioctl()) with the request value as second argument and a pointer to
   the integer value as third argument.
label(OPTION_IOCTL_BIN)dit(bf(tt(ioctl-bin=<request>:<value>)))
   Calls tt(ioctl()) with the request value as second argument and a pointer to
   the given data value as third argument. This data must be specified in
   link(<dalan>)(TYPE_DATA) form.
label(OPTION_IOCTL_STRING)dit(bf(tt(ioctl-string=<request>:<value>)))
   Calls tt(ioctl()) with the request value as second argument and a pointer to
   the given string as third argument.
   link(<dalan>)(TYPE_DATA) form.

   privilege. 
label(OPTION_UMASK)dit(bf(tt(umask=<mode>)))
   Sets the umask of the process to <mode> [link(mode_t)(TYPE_MODE_T)] before
   accessing the file system entry (useful 
   with unixdomain() sockets!). This call might affect all further operations
   of the socat() process!  
label(OPTION_UNLINK_EARLY)dit(bf(tt(unlink-early)))
   Unlinks (removes) the file before opening it and even before applying
   user-early etc. 
label(OPTION_UNLINK)dit(bf(tt(unlink)))
   Unlinks (removes) the file before accessing it, but after user-early etc.
label(OPTION_UNLINK_LATE)dit(bf(tt(unlink-late)))
   Unlinks (removes) the file after opening it to make it inaccessible for
   other processes after a short race condition. 
label(OPTION_UNLINK_CLOSE)dit(bf(tt(unlink-close)))
   Removes the addresses file system entry when closing the address.
   For link(named pipes)(ADDRESS_NAMED_PIPE),
   link(listening unix domain sockets)(ADDRESS_UNIX_LISTEN),
   and the link(symbolic links)(OPTION_SYMBOLIC_LINK) of link(pty addresses)(ADDRESS_PTY),

startdit()
label(OPTION_SEEK)dit(bf(tt(seek=<offset>)))
   Applies the code(lseek(fd, <offset>, SEEK_SET)) (or code(lseek64)) system
   call, thus positioning the file pointer absolutely to <offset>
   [link(off_t)(TYPE_OFF) or link(off64_t)(TYPE_OFF64)]. Please note that a

startdit()
label(OPTION_CHROOT)dit(bf(tt(chroot=<directory>)))
   Performs a code(chroot()) operation to link(<directory>)(TYPE_DIRECTORY)
   after processing the address (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_CHROOT)). This call might require root privilege.
label(OPTION_CHROOT_EARLY)dit(bf(tt(chroot-early=<directory>)))
   Performs a code(chroot()) operation to link(<directory>)(TYPE_DIRECTORY)

   that this option does not drop other group related privileges.
label(OPTION_SETGID_EARLY)dit(bf(tt(setgid-early=<group>)))
   Like link(setgit)(OPTION_SETGID) but is performed before opening the address.
label(OPTION_SETUID)dit(bf(tt(setuid=<user>)))
   Changes the link(<user>)(TYPE_USER) (owner) of the process after processing

   Reads and writes history from/to link(<filename>)(TYPE_FILENAME) (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_HISTORY)).
label(OPTION_NOPROMPT)dit(bf(tt(noprompt)))
   Since version 1.4.0, socat per default tries to determine a prompt - 
   that is then passed to the readline call - by remembering the last
   incomplete line of the output. With this option, socat does not pass a
   prompt to readline, so it begins line editing in the first column
   of the terminal. 
label(OPTION_NOECHO)dit(bf(tt(noecho=<pattern>)))
   Specifies a regular pattern for a prompt that prevents the following input
   line from being displayed on the screen and from being added to the history.
   The prompt is defined as the text that was output to the readline address 
   after the lastest newline character and before an input character was
   typed. The pattern is a regular expression, e.g.
   "^[Pp]assword:.*$" or "([Uu]ser:|[Pp]assword:)". See NOEXPAND(regex(7)) for details.
   (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_NOECHO))
label(OPTION_PROMPT)dit(bf(tt(prompt=<string>)))
   Passes the string as prompt to the readline function. readline prints this
   prompt when stepping through the history. If this string matches a constant
   prompt issued by an interactive program on the other socat address,
   consistent look and feel can be archieved.

label(OPTION_CRNL)dit(bf(tt(crnl)))
   Converts the default line termination character NL ('\n', 0x0a) to/from CRNL
   ("\r\n", 0x0d0a) when writing/reading on this channel (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_CRNL)).
   Note: socat simply strips all CR characters.
label(OPTION_IGNOREEOF)dit(bf(tt(ignoreeof)))
   When EOF occurs on this channel, socat() ignores it and tries to read more
   data (like "tail -f") (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_IGNOREEOF)).
label(OPTION_READBYTES)dit(bf(tt(readbytes=<bytes>)))
   socat() reads only so many bytes from this address (the address provides
   only so many bytes for transfer and pretends to be at EOF afterwards).
   Must be greater than 0.
label(OPTION_LOCKFILE)dit(bf(tt(lockfile=<filename>)))
   If lockfile exists, exits with error. If lockfile does not exist, creates it
   and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.
label(OPTION_WAITLOCK)dit(bf(tt(waitlock=<filename>)))
   If lockfile exists, waits until it disappears. When lockfile does not exist,
   creates it and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.
label(OPTION_ESCAPE)dit(bf(tt(escape=<int>)))

label(OPTION_KEEPALIVE)dit(bf(tt(keepalive)))
   Enables sending keepalives on the socket.
label(OPTION_LINGER)dit(bf(tt(linger=<seconds>)))
   Blocks code(shutdown()) or code(close()) until data transfers have finished
   or the given timeout [link(int)(TYPE_INT)] expired. 
COMMENT(label(OPTION_NOREUSEADDR)dit(bf(tt(noreuseaddr)))

label(OPTION_OOBINLINE)dit(bf(tt(oobinline)))
   Places out-of-band data in the input data stream.
label(OPTION_PRIORITY)dit(bf(tt(priority=<priority>)))
   Sets the protocol defined <priority> [link(<int>)(TYPE_INT)] for outgoing
   packets. 
label(OPTION_RCVBUF)dit(bf(tt(rcvbuf=<bytes>)))
   Sets the size of the receive buffer after the code(socket()) call to
   <bytes> [link(int)(TYPE_INT)].  With TCP
   sockets, this value corresponds to the socket's maximal window size.
label(OPTION_RCVBUF_LATE)dit(bf(tt(rcvbuf-late=<bytes>)))
   Sets the size of the receive buffer when the socket is already

em(bf(UDP, TCP, and SCTP option groups))

Here we find options that are related to the network port mechanism and thus
can be used with UDP, TCP, and SCTP client and server addresses.
startdit()
label(OPTION_SOURCEPORT)dit(bf(tt(sourceport=<port>)))
   For outgoing (client) TCP and UDP connections, it sets the source
   link(<port>)(TYPE_PORT) using an extra code(bind()) call.
   With TCP or UDP listen addresses, socat immediately shuts down the
   connection if the client does not use this sourceport (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_SOURCEPORT)).
label(OPTION_LOWPORT)dit(bf(tt(lowport)))
   Outgoing (client) TCP and UDP connections with this option use
   an unused random source port between 640 and 1023 incl. On UNIX class operating
   systems, this requires root privilege, and thus indicates that the
   client process is authorized by local root.
   TCP and UDP listen addresses with this option immediately shut down the
   connection if the client does not use a sourceport <= 1023.
   This mechanism can provide limited authorization under some circumstances.

   Overrides the default HTTP proxy port 8080 with
   link(<TCP service>)(TYPE_TCP_SERVICE).
label(OPTION_IGNORECR)dit(bf(tt(ignorecr)))
   The HTTP protocol requires the use of CR+NL as line terminator. When a proxy
   server violates this standard, socat might not understand its answer. 
   This option directs socat to interprete NL as line terminator and
   to ignore CR in the answer. Nevertheless, socat sends CR+NL to the proxy.
label(OPTION_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION)dit(bf(tt(proxyauth=<username>:<password>)))
   Provide "basic" authentication to the proxy server. The argument to the
   option is used with a "Proxy-Authorization: Base" header in base64 encoded
   form.nl() 
   Note: username and password are visible for every user on the local machine
   in the process list; username and password are transferred to the proxy
   server unencrypted (base64 encoded) and might be sniffed.
label(OPTION_PROXY_RESOLVE)dit(bf(tt(resolve)))
   Per default, socat sends to the proxy a CONNECT request containing the
   target hostname. With this option, socat resolves the hostname locally and
   sends the IP address. Please note that, according to RFC 2396, only name
   resolution to IPv4 addresses is implemented.

label(GROUP_RANGE)em(bf(RANGE option group))

These options check if a connecting client should be granted access. They can
be applied to listening and receiving network sockets. tcp-wrappers options
fall into this group.
startdit()
label(OPTION_RANGE)dit(bf(tt(range=<address-range>)))
   After accepting a connection, tests if the peer is within em(range). For
   IPv4 addresses, address-range takes the form address/bits, e.g.
   10.0.0.0/8, or address:mask, e.g. 10.0.0.0:255.0.0.0 (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_RANGE)); for IPv6, it is [ip6-address/bits], e.g. [::1/128].
   If the client address does not match, socat() issues a warning and keeps
   listening/receiving.
label(OPTION_TCPWRAPPERS)dit(bf(tt(tcpwrap[=<name>])))
   Uses Wietse Venema's libwrap (tcpd) library to determine
   if the client is allowed to connect. The configuration files are
   /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny per default, see "man 5 hosts_access"
   for more information. The optional <name> (type link(string)(TYPE_STRING))
   is passed to the wrapper functions as daemon process name (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_TCPWRAPPERS)). 
   If omitted, the basename of socats invocation (argv[0]) is passed. 
   If both tcpwrap and range options are applied to an address, both
   conditions must be fulfilled to allow the connection.
label(OPTION_TCPWRAP_HOSTS_ALLOW_TABLE)dit(bf(tt(allow-table=<filename>)))
   Takes the specified file instead of /etc/hosts.allow.
label(OPTION_TCPWRAP_HOSTS_DENY_TABLE)dit(bf(tt(deny-table=<filename>)))
   Takes the specified file instead of /etc/hosts.deny.
label(OPTION_TCPWRAP_ETC)dit(bf(tt(tcpwrap-etc=<directoryname>)))
   Looks for hosts.allow and hosts.deny in the specified directory. Is

   OPENSSL-CONNECT and OPENSSL-LISTEN differ in when they actually fork off the
   child:
   OPENSSL-LISTEN forks em(before) the SSL handshake, while OPENSSL-CONNECT
   forks em(afterwards).

default, a code(socketpair()) is created and assigned to stdin and stdout of
the child process, while stderr is inherited from the socat() process, and the
child process uses file descriptors 0 and 1 for communicating with the main
socat process.
startdit()
label(OPTION_NOFORK)dit(bf(tt(nofork)))
   Does not fork a subprocess for executing the program, instead calls NOEXPAND(execvp())
   or NOEXPAND(system()) directly from the actual socat instance. This avoids the
   overhead of another process between the program and its peer,
   but introduces a lot of restrictions:
   startit()
   it() this option can only be applied to the second socat() address.
   it() it cannot be applied to a part of a link(dual)(ADDRESS_DUAL) address.
   it() the first socat address cannot be OPENSSL or READLINE
   it() socat options -b, -t, -D, -l, -v, -x become useless
   it() for both addresses, options ignoreeof, cr, and crnl become useless
   it() for the second address (the one with option nofork), options 
      append, metaCOMMENT(async,) cloexec, flock, user, group, mode, nonblock,
      perm-late, setlk, and setpgid cannot be applied. Some of these could be
      used on the first address though.
   endit()
label(OPTION_PIPES)dit(bf(tt(pipes)))
   Creates a pair of unnamed pipes for interprocess communication instead of a
   socket pair.
label(OPTION_OPENPTY)dit(bf(tt(openpty)))
   Establishes communication with the sub process using a pseudo terminal
   created with code(openpty()) instead of the default (socketpair or ptmx).
label(OPTION_PTMX)dit(bf(tt(ptmx)))
   Establishes communication with the sub process using a pseudo terminal
   created by opening file(/dev/ptmx) or file(/dev/ptc) instead of the default
   (socketpair).
label(OPTION_PTY)dit(bf(tt(pty)))
   Establishes communication with the sub process using a pseudo terminal
   instead of a socket pair. Creates the pty with an available mechanism. If
   openpty and ptmx are both available, it uses ptmx because this is POSIX
   compliant (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_PTY)).
label(OPTION_CTTY)dit(bf(tt(ctty)))
   Makes the pty the controlling tty of the sub process (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_CTTY)).
label(OPTION_STDERR)dit(bf(tt(stderr)))
   Directs stderr of the sub process to its output channel by making stderr a
   code(dup()) of stdout (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_STDERR)). 
label(OPTION_FDIN)dit(bf(tt(fdin=<fdnum>)))
   Assigns the sub processes input channel to its file descriptor
   link(<fdnum>)(TYPE_FDNUM) 
   instead of stdin (0). The program started from the subprocess has to use
   this fd for reading data from socat() (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_FDIN)). 
label(OPTION_FDOUT)dit(bf(tt(fdout=<fdnum>)))
   Assigns the sub processes output channel to its file descriptor
   link(<fdnum>)(TYPE_FDNUM) 
   instead of stdout (1). The program started from the subprocess has to use 
   this fd for writing data to socat() (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_FDOUT)).
label(OPTION_SIGHUP)label(OPTION_SIGINT)label(OPTION_SIGQUIT)dit(bf(tt(sighup)), bf(tt(sigint)), bf(tt(sigquit)))
   Has socat() pass signals of this type to the sub process.
   If no address has this option, socat terminates on these signals.

label(GROUP_TERMIOS)em(bf(TERMIOS option group))

For addresses that work on a tty (e.g., stdio, file:/dev/tty, exec:...,pty), the terminal parameters defined in the unix() termios mechanism are made available as address option parameters.
Please note that changes of the parameters of your interactive terminal 
remain effective after socat()'s termination, so you might have to enter "reset"
or "stty sane" in your shell afterwards.
For EXEC and SYSTEM addresses with option PTY,
these options apply to the pty by the child processes.

startdit()

label(GROUP_PTY)em(bf(PTY option group))

These options are intended for use with the link(pty)(ADDRESS_PTY) address
type.

startdit()
label(OPTION_SYMBOLIC_LINK)dit(bf(tt(link=<filename>)))
   Generates a symbolic link that points to the actual pseudo terminal
   (pty). This might help 
   to solve the problem that ptys are generated with more or less
   unpredictable names, making it difficult to directly access the socat
   generated pty automatically. With this option, the user can specify a "fix"
   point in the file hierarchy that helps him to access the actual pty
   (link(example)(EXAMPLE_OPTION_SYMBOLIC_LINK)).
   Beginning with socat() version 1.4.3, the symbolic link is removed when
   the address is closed (but see option link(unlink-close)(OPTION_UNLINK_CLOSE)).
label(OPTION_PTY_WAIT_SLAVE)dit(bf(tt(wait-slave)))
   Blocks the open phase until a process opens the slave side of the pty.
   Usually, socat continues after generating the pty with opening the next
   address or with entering the transfer loop. With the wait-slave option,
   socat waits until some process opens the slave side of the pty before
   continuing. 
   This option only works if the operating system provides the tt(poll())
   system call. And it depends on an undocumented behaviour of pty's, so it
   does not work on all operating systems. It has successfully been tested on
   Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and on Tru64 with openpty. 
label(OPTION_PTY_INTERVAL)dit(bf(tt(pty-interval=<seconds>)))
   When the link(wait-slave)(OPTION_PTY_WAIT_SLAVE) option is set, socat
   periodically checks the HUP condition using tt(poll()) to find if the pty's
   slave side has been opened. The default polling interval is 1s. Use the
   pty-interval option [link(timeval)(TYPE_TIMEVAL)] to change this value.

label(GROUP_OPENSSL)em(bf(OPENSSL option group))

These options apply to the link(openssl)(ADDRESS_OPENSSL_CONNECT) and
link(openssl-listen)(ADDRESS_OPENSSL_LISTEN) address types.

startdit()
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_CIPHERLIST)dit(bf(tt(cipher=<cipherlist>)))
   Selects the list of ciphers that may be used for the connection.
   See the man page of code(ciphers), section bf(CIPHER LIST FORMAT), for
   detailed information about syntax, values, and default of <cipherlist>.nl()
   Several cipher strings may be given, separated by ':'.
   Some simple cipher strings:
   startdit()
   dit(3DES) Uses a cipher suite with triple DES.
   dit(MD5) Uses a cipher suite with MD5.
   dit(aNULL) Uses a cipher suite without authentication.
   dit(NULL) Does not use encryption.
   dit(HIGH) Uses a cipher suite with "high" encryption.
   enddit()
   Note that the peer must support the selected property, or the negotiation
   will fail.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_METHOD)dit(bf(tt(method=<ssl-method>)))
   Sets the protocol version to be used. Valid strings (not case sensitive)
   are:  
   startdit()
   dit(tt(SSL2)) Select SSL protocol version 2.
   dit(tt(SSL3)) Select SSL protocol version 3.
   dit(tt(SSL23)) Select the best available SSL or TLS protocol. This is the default when
   this option is not provided.
   dit(tt(TLS1)) Select TLS protocol version 1.
   dit(tt(TLS1.1)) Select TLS protocol version 1.1.
   dit(tt(TLS1.2)) Select TLS protocol version 1.2.
   dit(tt(DTLS1)) Select DTLS protocol version 1.
   enddit()
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_VERIFY)dit(bf(tt(verify=<bool>)))
   Controls check of the peer's certificate. Default is 1 (true). Disabling
   verify might open your socket for everyone, making the encryption useless!
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_CERTIFICATE)dit(bf(tt(cert=<filename>)))
   Specifies the file with the certificate and private key for authentication. 
   The certificate must be in OpenSSL format (*.pem). 
   With openssl-listen, use of this option is strongly
   recommended. Except with cipher aNULL, "no shared ciphers" error will
   occur when no certificate is given.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_KEY)dit(bf(tt(key=<filename>)))
   Specifies the file with the private key. The private key may be in this
   file or in the file given with the link(cert)(OPTION_OPENSSL_CERTIFICATE) option. The party that has
   to proof that it is the owner of a certificate needs the private key.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_DHPARAMS)dit(bf(tt(dhparams=<filename>)))
   Specifies the file with the Diffie Hellman parameters. These parameters may
   also be in the file given with the link(cert)(OPTION_OPENSSL_CERTIFICATE)
   option in which case the dhparams option is not needed.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_CAFILE)dit(bf(tt(cafile=<filename>)))
   Specifies the file with the trusted (root) authority certificates. The file
   must be in PEM format and should contain one or more certificates. The party
   that checks the authentication of its peer trusts only certificates that are
   in this file.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_CAPATH)dit(bf(tt(capath=<dirname>)))
   Specifies the directory with the trusted (root) certificates. The directory
   must contain certificates in PEM format and their hashes (see OpenSSL
   documentation) 
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_EGD)dit(bf(tt(egd=<filename>)))
   On some systems, openssl requires an explicit source of random data. Specify
   the socket name where an entropy gathering daemon like egd provides random
   data, e.g. /dev/egd-pool.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_PSEUDO)dit(bf(tt(pseudo)))
   On systems where openssl cannot find an entropy source and where no entropy
   gathering daemon can be utilized, this option activates a mechanism for
   providing pseudo entropy. This is archieved by taking the current time in
   microseconds for feeding the libc pseudo random number generator with an
   initial value. openssl is then feeded with output from NOEXPAND(random()) calls.nl()
   NOTE:This mechanism is not sufficient for generation of secure keys!
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_COMPRESS)dit(bf(tt(compress)))
   Enable or disable the use of compression for a connection. Setting this to
   "none" disables compression, setting it to "auto" lets OpenSSL choose the best
   available algorithm supported by both parties. The default is to not touch any
   compression-related settings.
   NOTE: Requires OpenSSL 0.9.8 or higher and disabling compression with
   OpenSSL 0.9.8 affects all new connections in the process.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_COMMONNAME)dit(bf(tt(commonname=<string>)))
   Specify the commonname that the peer certificate must match. With
   link(OPENSSL-CONNECT)(ADDRESS_OPENSSL_CONNECT) address this overrides the
   given hostname or IP target address; with
   link(OPENSSL-LISTEN)(ADDRESS_OPENSSL_LISTEN) this turns on check of peer
   certificates commonname. This option has only meaning when option
   link(verify)(OPTION_OPENSSL_VERIFY) is not disabled and the chosen cipher
   provides a peer certificate.
label(OPTION_OPENSSL_FIPS)dit(bf(tt(fips)))
   Enables FIPS mode if compiled in. For info about the FIPS encryption
   implementation standard see lurl(http://oss-institute.org/fips-faq.html). 
   This mode might require that the involved certificates are generated with a
   FIPS enabled version of openssl. Setting or clearing this option on one
   socat address affects all OpenSSL addresses of this process.

label(GROUP_RETRY)em(bf(RETRY option group))

Options that control retry of some system calls, especially connection
attempts.

startdit()
label(OPTION_RETRY)dit(bf(tt(retry=<num>)))
   Number of retries before the connection or listen attempt is aborted. 
   Default is 0, which means just one attempt. 
label(OPTION_INTERVAL)dit(bf(tt(interval=<timespec>)))
   Time between consecutive attempts (seconds,

   Gives the resulting network interface a specific name instead of the system
   generated (tun0, tun1, etc.)
label(OPTION_TUN_TYPE)dit(bf(tt(tun-type=[tun|tap])))
   Sets the type of the TUN device; use this option to generate a TAP
   device. See the Linux docu for the difference between these types.

   should be the same.
label(OPTION_IFF_NO_PI)dit(bf(tt(iff-no-pi)))
   Sets the IFF_NO_PI flag which controls if the device includes additional
   packet information in the tunnel.
   When you try to establish a tunnel between two TUN devices, these flags
   should have the same values.
label(OPTION_IFF_UP)dit(bf(tt(iff-up)))
   Sets the TUN network interface status UP. Strongly recommended.

label(EXAMPLE_ADDRESS_TCP4_CONNECT)
dit(bf(tt(socat - TCP4:www.domain.org:80)))

transfers data between link(STDIO)(ADDRESS_STDIO) (-) and a
link(TCP4)(ADDRESS_TCP4_CONNECT) connection to port 80 of host 
www.domain.org. This example results in an interactive connection similar to
telnet or netcat. The stdin terminal parameters are not changed, so you may
close the relay with ^D or abort it with ^C.

htmlcommand(<dt><code><strong>socat -d -d  READLINE,history=$HOME/.http_history \</strong><br>
<strong>TCP4:www.domain.org:www,crnl</strong></code><dd>)

this is similar to the previous example, but you can edit the current line in a
bash like manner (link(READLINE)(ADDRESS_READLINE)) and use the
link(history)(OPTION_HISTORY) file .http_history; socat() prints messages about
progress (link(-d -d)(option_d_d)). The  port is specified by service name
(www), and correct network line termination characters
(link(crnl)(OPTION_CRNL)) instead of NL are used.


label(EXAMPLE_ADDRESS_TCP4_LISTEN)
dit(bf(tt(socat TCP4-LISTEN:www TCP4:www.domain.org:www)))

installs a simple TCP port forwarder. With
link(TCP4-LISTEN)(ADDRESS_TCP4_LISTEN) it listens on local port "www" until a
connection comes in, accepts it, then connects to the remote host
(link(TCP4)(ADDRESS_TCP4_CONNECT)) and starts data transfer. It will not accept
a econd connection.

TCP port forwarder, each side bound to another local IP address
(link(bind)(OPTION_BIND)). This example handles an almost
arbitrary number of parallel or consecutive connections by
link(fork)(OPTION_FORK)'ing a new 
process after each code(accept()). It provides a little security by
link(su)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER)'ing to user 
nobody after forking; it only permits connections from the private 10 network
(link(range)(OPTION_RANGE)); due to link(reuseaddr)(OPTION_REUSEADDR), it
allows immediate restart after master process's termination, even if some child
sockets are not completely shut down.
With link(-lmlocal2)(option_lm), socat logs to stderr until successfully
reaching the accept loop. Further logging is directed to syslog with facility
local2.

htmlcommand(<dt><code><strong>socat TCP4-LISTEN:5555,fork,tcpwrap=script \</strong><br>
<strong>EXEC:/bin/myscript,chroot=/home/sandbox,su-d=sandbox,pty,stderr</strong></code><dd>)

a simple server that accepts connections
(link(TCP4-LISTEN)(ADDRESS_TCP4_LISTEN)) and link(fork)(OPTION_FORK)'s a new
child process for each connection; every child acts as single relay. 
The client must match the rules for daemon process name "script" in
/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny, otherwise it is refused access (see "man
5 hosts_access").
For link(EXEC)(ADDRESS_EXEC)'uting the program, the child process
link(chroot)(OPTION_CHROOT)'s 
to file(/home/sandbox), link(su)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER)'s to user sandbox, and then starts 
the program file(/home/sandbox/bin/myscript). Socat() and
myscript communicate via a pseudo tty (link(pty)(OPTION_PTY)); myscript's
link(stderr)(OPTION_STDERR) is redirected to stdout,
so its error messages are transferred via socat() to the connected client.

<strong>TCP4:mail.relay.org:25,crnl,bind=alias1.server.org,mss=512</strong></code><dd>)

file(mail.sh) is a shell script, distributed with socat(), that implements a
simple 
SMTP client. It is programmed to "speak" SMTP on its FDs 3 (in) and 4 (out).
The link(fdin)(OPTION_FDIN) and link(fdout)(OPTION_FDOUT) options tell socat()
to use these FDs for communication with 
the program. Because mail.sh inherits stdin and stdout while socat() does not
use them, the script can read a
mail body from stdin. Socat() makes alias1 your local source address
(link(bind)(OPTION_BIND)), cares for correct network line termination
(link(crnl)(OPTION_CRNL)) and sends  
at most 512 data bytes per packet (link(mss)(OPTION_MSS)).

label(EXAMPLE_OPTION_TERMIOS_RAWER)
label(EXAMPLE_OPTION_ESCAPE)
dit(bf(tt(socat -,escape=0x0f /dev/ttyS0,rawer,crnl)))

opens an interactive connection via the serial line, e.g. for talking with a
modem. link(rawer)(OPTION_TERMIOS_RAWER) sets the console's and
ttyS0's terminal parameters to practicable values, link(crnl)(OPTION_CRNL) 
converts to correct newline characters. link(escape)(OPTION_ESCAPE) allows
terminating the socat process with character control-O.

<strong>SOCKS4:host.victim.org:127.0.0.1:6000,socksuser=nobody,sourceport=20</strong></code><dd>)

with link(UNIX-LISTEN)(ADDRESS_UNIX_LISTEN), socat() opens a listening
unixdomain() socket file(/tmp/.X11-unix/X1). This path corresponds 
to local XWindow display :1 on your machine, so XWindow client connections to
DISPLAY=:1 are accepted. Socat() then speaks with
the link(SOCKS4)(ADDRESS_SOCKS4) server host.victim.org that might permit 
link(sourceport)(OPTION_SOURCEPORT) 20 based connections due to an FTP related
weakness in its static IP filters. Socat()
pretends to be invoked by link(socksuser)(OPTION_SOCKSUSER) nobody, and
requests to be connected to 
loopback port 6000 (only weak sockd configurations will allow this). So we get
a connection to the victims XWindow server and, if it does not require MIT
cookies or Kerberos authentication, we can start work. Please note that there
can only be one connection at a time, because TCP can establish only one
session with a given set of addresses and ports.


label(EXAMPLE_option_u)
label(EXAMPLE_OPTION_IGNOREEOF)
dit(bf(tt(socat -u /tmp/readdata,seek-end=0,ignoreeof -)))

this is an example for unidirectional data transfer
(link(-u)(option_u)). Socat() transfers data 
from file /tmp/readdata (implicit address link(GOPEN)(ADDRESS_GOPEN)), starting
at its current end (link(seek-end)(OPTION_SEEK_END)=0 lets socat() start 
reading at current end of file; use link(seek)(OPTION_SEEK)=0 or no
seek option to first read the existing data) in a "tail -f" like mode
(link(ignoreeof)(OPTION_IGNOREEOF)). The "file" 
might also be a listening unixdomain() socket (do not use a seek option then).

htmlcommand(<dt><code><strong>(sleep 5; echo PASSWORD; sleep 5; echo ls; sleep 1) |</strong><br>
<strong>socat - EXEC:'ssh -l user server',pty,setsid,ctty</strong></code><dd>)

link(EXEC)(ADDRESS_EXEC)'utes an ssh session to server. Uses a link(pty)(OPTION_PTY) for communication between socat() and
ssh, makes it ssh's controlling tty (link(ctty)(OPTION_CTTY)), 
and makes this pty the owner of
a new process group (link(setsid)(OPTION_SETSID)), so ssh accepts the password from socat().

For each client connecting to port 3334, a new child process is generated (option link(fork)(OPTION_FORK)).
All data sent by the clients are link(append)(OPTION_APPEND)'ed to the file /tmp/in.log.
If the file does not exist, socat link(creat)(OPTION_O_CREAT)'s it. 
Option link(reuseaddr)(OPTION_REUSEADDR) allows immediate restart of the server
process. 

COMMENT(

implements a simple network based motd server.
For each client connecting to port 3335, a new child process is generated
(option link(fork)(OPTION_FORK)).
The contents of the file /tmp/motd is sent to each client.
Messages sent by clients result in an error due to option link(rdonly)(OPTION_RDONLY).
Option link(reuseaddr)(OPTION_REUSEADDR) allows immediate restart of the server
process.

label(EXAMPLE_OPTION_NOECHO)
dit(bf(tt(socat READLINE,noecho='[Pp]assword:' EXEC:'ftp ftp.server.com',pty,setsid,ctty)))

wraps a command line history (link(READLINE)(ADDRESS_READLINE)) around the link(EXEC)(ADDRESS_EXEC)'uted ftp client utility.
This allows editing and reuse of FTP commands for relatively comfortable
browsing through the ftp directory hierarchy. The password is echoed!
 link(pty)(OPTION_PTY) is required to have ftp issue a prompt.
Nevertheless, there may occur some confusion with the password and FTP

(link(proxyport)(OPTION_PROXYPORT)) on host proxy, using the
CONNECT method, where they are authenticated as "user" with "pass" (link(proxyauth)(OPTION_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION)). The proxy

label(EXAMPLE_ADDRESS_OPENSSL_CONNECT)
dit(bf(tt(socat - SSL:server:4443,cafile=server.crt,cert=client.pem)))

is an OpenSSL client that tries to establish a secure connection to an SSL
server. Option link(cafile)(OPTION_OPENSSL_CAFILE) specifies a file that
contains trust certificates: we trust the server only when it presents one of
these certificates and proofs that it owns the related private key. 
Otherwise the connection is terminated.
With link(cert)(OPTION_OPENSSL_CERTIFICATE) a file containing the client certificate
and the associated private key is specified. This is required in case the
server wishes a client authentication; many Internet servers do not.nl()
The first address ('-') can be replaced by almost any other socat address.


label(EXAMPLE_ADDRESS_OPENSSL_LISTEN)
dit(bf(tt(socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:4443,reuseaddr,pf=ip4,fork,cert=server.pem,cafile=client.crt PIPE)))

from the file server.pem and forces the client to present a certificate that is
verified against cafile.crt.nl()
The second address ('PIPE') can be replaced by almost any other socat
address.nl()
For instructions on generating and distributing OpenSSL keys and certificates
see the additional socat docu tt(socat-openssl.txt).


dit(bf(tt(echo |socat -u - file:/tmp/bigfile,create,largefile,seek=100000000000)))

creates a 100GB sparse file; this requires a file system type that
supports this (ext2, ext3, reiserfs, jfs; not minix, vfat). The operation of
writing 1 byte might take long (reiserfs: some minutes; ext2: "no" time), and
the resulting file can consume some disk space with just its inodes (reiserfs:
2MB; ext2: 16KB). 


dit(bf(tt(socat tcp-l:7777,reuseaddr,fork system:'filan -i 0 -s >&2',nofork)))

listens for incoming TCP connections on port 7777. For each accepted
connection, invokes a shell. This shell has its stdin and stdout directly
connected to the TCP socket (link(nofork)(OPTION_NOFORK)).  The shell starts filan and lets it print the socket addresses to
stderr (your terminal window).


dit(bf(tt(echo -e "\0\14\0\0\c" |socat -u - file:/usr/bin/squid.exe,seek=0x00074420)))

functions as primitive binary editor: it writes the 4 bytes 000 014 000 000 to
the executable /usr/bin/squid at offset 0x00074420 (this is a real world patch
to make the squid executable from Cygwin run under Windows, actual per May 2004).

connects to an unknown service and prevents being flooded.


label(EXAMPLE_END_CLOSE)

merges data arriving from different TCP streams on port 8888 to just one stream
to target:9999. The link(end-close)(OPTION_END_CLOSE) option prevents the child
processes forked off by the second address from terminating the shared
connection to 9999 (NOEXPAND(close(2)) just unlinks the inode which stays active as long
as the parent process lives; NOEXPAND(shutdown(2)) would actively terminate the
connection).

dit(bf(tt(socat - UDP4-DATAGRAM:224.255.0.1:6666,bind=:6666,ip-add-membership=224.255.0.1:eth0)))

transfers data from stdin to the specified multicast address using UDP. Both
local and remote ports are 6666. Tells the interface eth0 to also accept
multicast packets of the given group. Multiple hosts on the local network can
run this command, so all data sent by any of the hosts will be received
by all the other ones. Note that there are many possible reasons for failure,
including IP-filters, routing issues, wrong interface selection by the
operating system, bridges, or a badly configured switch.


label(EXAMPLE_ADDRESS_TUN)
dit(bf(tt(socat TCP:host2:4443 TUN:192.168.255.1/24,up)))

establishes one side of a virtual (but not private!) network with host2 where a
similar process might run, with UDP-L and tun address 192.168.255.2. They can
reach each other using the addresses 192.168.255.1 and 192.168.255.2. Note that
streaming eg. via TCP or SSL does not guarantee to retain packet boundaries and
may thus cause packet loss.


label(EXAMPLE_INTERFACE)
dit(bf(tt(socat PTY,link=/var/run/ppp,rawer INTERFACE:hdlc0)))

circumvents the problem that pppd requires a serial device and thus might not
be able to work on a synchronous line that is represented by a network device.
socat creates a PTY to make pppd happy, binds to the network
link(interface)(ADDRESS_INTERFACE) tt(hdlc0), and can transfer data between
both devices. Use pppd on device tt(/var/run/ppp) then.

waits for an incoming UDP packet on port 9999 and prints the environment 
variables provided by socat. On BSD based systems you have to replace
link(tt(ip-pktinfo))(OPTION_IP_PKTINFO) with link(tt(ip-recvdstaddr))(OPTION_IP_RECVDSTADDR),link(tt(ip-recvif))(OPTION_IP_RECVIF). Especially interesting is
SOCAT_IP_DSTADDR: it contains the target address of the packet which may be a
unicast, multicast, or broadcast address.

e.g. tt("1.7.0.0") for released versions or e.g. tt("1.6.0.1+envvar") for
temporary versions; can be used in scripts invoked by socat. 

dit(bf(SOCAT_PID) (output)) Socat sets this variable to its process id. In case
of link(fork)(OPTION_FORK) address option, SOCAT_PID gets the child processes
id. Forking for link(exec)(ADDRESS_EXEC) and link(system)(ADDRESS_SYSTEM) does
not change SOCAT_PID.

dit(bf(SOCAT_PPID) (output)) Socat sets this variable to its process id. In
case of link(fork)(OPTION_FORK), SOCAT_PPID keeps the pid of the master process.

dit(bf(SOCAT_PEERADDR) (output)) With passive socket addresses (all LISTEN and
RECVFROM addresses), this variable is set to a string describing the peers
socket address. Port information is not included.

dit(bf(SOCAT_PEERPORT) (output)) With appropriate passive socket addresses
(TCP, UDP, and SCTP - LISTEN and RECVFROM), this variable is set to a string containing the
number of the peer port.

dit(bf(SOCAT_SOCKADDR) (output)) With all LISTEN addresses, this variable is
set to a string describing the local socket address. Port information is not
included link(example)(EXAMPLE_HTTPECHO)

dit(bf(SOCAT_SOCKPORT) (output)) With link(TCP-LISTEN)(ADDRESS_TCP_LISTEN),
link(UDP-LISTEN)(ADDRESS_UDP_LISTEN), and
link(SCTP-LISTEN)(ADDRESS_SCTP_LISTEN) addresses, this variable is set to the
local port.

dit(bf(SOCAT_TIMESTAMP) (output)) With all RECVFROM addresses where address
option link(so-timestamp)(OPTION_SO_TIMESTAMP) is applied, socat sets this
variable to the resulting timestamp.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IP_OPTIONS) (output)) With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where 
address option link(ip-recvopts)(OPTION_IP_RECVOPTS) is applied, socat fills
this variable with the IP options of the received packet.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IP_DSTADDR) (output)) With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where
address option link(ip-recvdstaddr)(OPTION_IP_RECVDSTADDR) (BSD) or
link(ip-pktinfo)(OPTION_IP_PKTINFO) (other platforms) is applied, socat sets
this variable to the destination address of the received packet. This is
particularly useful to identify broadcast and multicast addressed packets.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IP_IF) (output)) With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where
address option link(ip-recvif)(OPTION_IP_RECVIF) (BSD) or
link(ip-pktinfo)(OPTION_IP_PKTINFO) (other platforms) is applied, socat sets 
this variable to the name of the interface where the packet was received.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IP_LOCADDR) (output)) With all IPv4 based RECVFROM
addresses where address option link(ip-pktinfo)(OPTION_IP_PKTINFO) is applied,
socat sets this variable to the address of the interface where the packet was
received.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IP_TOS) (output)) With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where
address option link(ip-recvtos)(OPTION_IP_RECVTOS) is applied, socat sets this
variable to the TOS (type of service) of the received packet.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IP_TTL) (output)) With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where
address option link(ip-recvttl)(OPTION_IP_RECVTTL) is applied, socat sets this
variable to the TTL (time to live) of the received packet.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IPV6_HOPLIMIT) (output)) With all IPv6 based RECVFROM addresses
where address option link(ipv6-recvhoplimit)(OPTION_IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT) is
applied, socat sets this variable to the hoplimit value of the received packet.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IPV6_DSTADDR) (output)) With all IPv6 based RECVFROM
addresses where address option link(ipv6-recvpktinfo)(OPTION_IPV6_RECVPKTINFO)
is applied, socat sets this variable to the destination address of the received
packet.

dit(bf(SOCAT_IPV6_TCLASS) (output)) With all IPv6 based RECVFROM addresses
where address option link(ipv6-recvtclass)(OPTION_IPV6_RECVTCLASS) is applied,
socat() sets this variable to the transfer class of the received packet.

dit(bf(SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509_ISSUER) (output)) Issuer field from peer certificate

dit(bf(SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509_SUBJECT) (output)) Subject field from peer certificate

dit(bf(SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509_COMMONNAME) (output)) commonName entries from peer certificates subject. Multiple values are separated by " // ".

dit(bf(SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509_*) (output)) all other entries from peer certificates subject

dit(bf(SOCAT_OPENSSL_X509V3_DNS) (output)) DNS entries from peer certificates extensions - subjectAltName field. Multiple values are separated by " // ".

dit(bf(HOSTNAME) (input)) Is used to determine the hostname for logging (see
link(-lh)(option_lh)).

dit(bf(LOGNAME) (input)) Is used as name for the socks client user name if no
link(socksuser)(OPTION_SOCKSUSER) is given.nl()
With options link(su)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER) and
link(su-d)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER_DELAYED), LOGNAME is set to the given user name.

dit(bf(USER) (input)) Is used as name for the socks client user name if no
link(socksuser)(OPTION_SOCKSUSER) is given and LOGNAME is empty.nl()
With options link(su)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER) and
link(su-d)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER_DELAYED), USER is set to the given user name.

dit(bf(SHELL) (output))
With options link(su)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER) and
link(su-d)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER_DELAYED), SHELL is set to the login shell of the
given user.

dit(bf(PATH) (output))
Can be set with option link(path)(OPTION_PATH) for link(exec)(ADDRESS_EXEC) and
link(system)(ADDRESS_SYSTEM) addresses.

dit(bf(HOME) (output))
With options link(su)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER) and
link(su-d)(OPTION_SUBSTUSER_DELAYED), HOME is set to the home directory of the
given user.

Addresses cannot be nested, so a single socat process cannot, e.g., drive ssl
over socks.

Address option ftruncate without value uses default 1 instead of 0.

Verbose modes (-x and/or -v) display line termination characters inconsistently
when address options cr or crnl are used: They show the data em(after)
conversion in either direction.

The data transfer blocksize setting (-b) is ignored with address readline.
