.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
.B pki
is a suite of commands that allow you to manage a simple public key
infrastructure (PKI).
.P
Generate RSA and ECDSA key pairs, create PKCS#10 certificate requests
containing subjectAltNames, create X.509 self-signed end-entity and root CA
certificates, issue end-entity and intermediate CA certificates signed by the
private key of a CA and containing subjectAltNames, CRL distribution points
and URIs of OCSP servers. You can also extract raw public keys from private
keys, certificate requests and certificates and compute two kinds of SHA-1-based
key IDs.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.
.SS "Generating a CA Certificate"
.
The first step is to generate a private key using the
.B \-\-gen
command. By default this generates a 2048-bit RSA key.
.PP
.EX
  pki \-\-gen > ca_key.der
.EE
.PP
This key is used to create the self-signed CA certificate, using the
.B \-\-self
command. The distinguished name should be adjusted to your needs.
.PP
.EX
  pki \-\-self \-\-ca \-\-in ca_key.der \\
      \-\-dn "C=CH, O=strongSwan, CN=strongSwan CA" > ca_cert.der
.EE
.PP
.
.SS "Generating End-Entity Certificates"
.
With the root CA certificate and key at hand end-entity certificates for clients
and servers can be issued. Similarly intermediate CA certificates can be issued,
which in turn can issue other certificates.
To generate a certificate for a server, we start by generating a private key.
.PP
.EX
  pki \-\-gen > server_key.der
.EE
.PP
The public key will be included in the certificate so lets extract that from the
private key.
.PP
.EX
  pki \-\-pub \-\-in server_key.der > server_pub.der
.EE
.PP
The following command will use the CA certificate and private key to issue the
certificate for this server. Adjust the distinguished name, subjectAltName(s)
and flags as needed (check
.BR pki\ \-\-issue (8)
for more options).
.PP
.EX
  pki \-\-issue \-\-in server_pub.der \-\-cacert ca_cert.der \\
      \-\-cakey ca_key.der \-\-dn "C=CH, O=strongSwan, CN=VPN Server" \\
      \-\-san vpn.strongswan.org \-\-flag serverAuth > server_cert.der
.EE
.PP
Instead of storing the public key in a separate
file, the output of
.B \-\-pub
may also be piped directly into the above command.
.
.SS "Generating Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL)"
.
If end-entity certificates have to be revoked, CRLs may be generated using
the
.B \-\-signcrl
command.
.PP
.EX
  pki \-\-signcrl \-\-cacert ca_cert.der \-\-cakey ca_key.der \\
      \-\-reason superseded \-\-cert server_cert.der > crl.der
.EE
.PP
The certificate given with \-\-cacert must be either a CA certificate or a
certificate with the
.I crlSign
extended key usage (\-\-flag crlSign). URIs to CRLs may be included in issued
certificates with the \-\-crl option.
