The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>
using <b>IKEv1 Aggressive Mode</b>.
The authentication is based on RSA signatures (<b>RSASIG</b>) using X.509 certificates
followed by extended authentication (<b>XAUTH</b>) of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b>
based on user names defined by the <b>xauth_identity</b> parameter (<b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b>,
respectively) and corresponding user passwords defined and stored in ipsec.secrets.
<p>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, leftfirewall=yes automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping the client
<b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
