<p>The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>. To authorize clients,
<b>moon</b> expects attribute certificates sent inline in IKEv2 CERT payloads.
<b>Carol</b> has attribute certificates for both the <i>sales</i> and
the <i>finance</i> groups. The attribute certificate for <i>finance</i> is not
valid anymore, hence <b>carol</b> gets access to the <i>sales</i> connection
only.</p>
<p>Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, <b>leftfirewall=yes</b>
automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, <b>carol</b> tries to ping both
<b>alice</b> and <b>venus</b>, but only the ping for the <i>sales</i> related
host <b>venus</b> succeeds.</p>
