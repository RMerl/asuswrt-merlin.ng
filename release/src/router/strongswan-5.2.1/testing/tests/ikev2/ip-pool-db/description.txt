The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration payload
by using the <b>leftsourceip=%config</b> parameter. The gateway <b>moon</b> assigns virtual IP
addresses from a pool named <b>bigpool</b> that was created in an SQL database by the command
<b>ipsec pool --name bigpool --start 10.3.0.1 --end 10.3.3.232 --timeout 0</b>.
<p>
<b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the
tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping the client
<b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two pings will be the
virtual IPs <b>carol1</b> and <b>dave1</b>, respectively.
