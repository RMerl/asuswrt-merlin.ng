A connection between the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> is set up.
The key exchange is based on NTRU encryption with a security strength of 128 bits.
The ANSI X9.98 NTRU encryption parameter set used is optimized for bandwidth.
<p/>
The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>. Upon the successful
establishment of the IPsec tunnel, <b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, client <b>alice</b> behind gateway <b>moon</b>
pings client <b>bob</b> located behind gateway <b>sun</b>.
