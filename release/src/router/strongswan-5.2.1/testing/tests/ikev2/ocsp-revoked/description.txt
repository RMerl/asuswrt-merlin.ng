By setting <b>strictcrlpolicy=yes</b>, a <b>strict</b> CRL policy is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. The online certificate status
is checked via the OCSP server <b>winnetou</b> which possesses an OCSP signer certificate
issued by the strongSwan CA. This certificate contains an <b>OCSPSigning</b>
extended key usage flag. A strongswan <b>ca</b> section in ipsec.conf defines an
<b>OCSP URI</b> pointing to <b>winnetou</b>.
<p>
<b>carol</b> tries to initiate an IPsec connection to <b>moon</b> but fails 
because <b>carol</b>'s certificate has been <b>revoked</b>.
