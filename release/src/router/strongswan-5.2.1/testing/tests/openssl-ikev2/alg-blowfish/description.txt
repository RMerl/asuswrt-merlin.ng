The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> as well as the gateway <b>moon</b>
use the <b>openssl</b> plugin based on the <b>OpenSSL</b> library for all
cryptographical functions, thus making the <b>Blowfish</b> available as an IKEv2 cipher.
<p>
The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b> using <b>Blowfish</b> for both IKE and ESP
encryption.  Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, <b>leftfirewall=yes</b>
automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
