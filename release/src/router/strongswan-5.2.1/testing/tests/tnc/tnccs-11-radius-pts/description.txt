The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
At the outset the gateway authenticates itself to the clients by sending an IKEv2
<b>RSA signature</b> accompanied by a certificate.
<b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then set up an <b>EAP-TTLS</b> tunnel each via <b>moon</b> to the
<a href="http://trust.inform.fh-hannover.de/joomla/index.php/projects/tncfhh" target="popup">
<b>TNC@FHH</b></a>-enhanced FreeRADIUS server <b>alice</b> authenticated by an X.509 AAA certificate.
The strong EAP-TTLS tunnel protects the ensuing weak client authentication based on <b>EAP-MD5</b>.
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> via the <b>IF-TNCCS 1.1</b> client-server interface.
The communication between the OS and Attestation IMC and the Attestation IMV is based on the
 <b>IF-M</b> protocol defined by <b>RFC 5792 PA-TNC</b>.
<p>
<b>carol</b> passes the health test and <b>dave</b> fails. Based on these measurements the clients
are connected by gateway <b>moon</b> to the "rw-allow" and "rw-isolate" subnets, respectively.
