The layer 2 supplicants <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> want to connect to a network
via switch <b>moon</b> which delegates the IEEE 802.1X authentication to the RADIUS
server <b>alice</b>. <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up an <b>EAP-TTLS</b> tunnel
each via <b>moon</b> to the <a href="http://trust.inform.fh-hannover.de/joomla/index.php/projects/tncfhh" target="popup"> <b>TNC@FHH</b></a>-enhanced FreeRADIUS server <b>alice</b> authenticated
by an X.509 AAA certificate.
The strong EAP-TTLS tunnel protects the ensuing weak client authentication based on <b>EAP-MD5</b>.
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> via the <b>IF-TNCCS 1.1</b> client-server interface.
The communication between IMCs and IMVs is based on the  <b>IF-M</b> protocol defined by <b>RFC 5792 PA-TNC</b>.
<p>
<b>carol</b> passes the health test and <b>dave</b> fails. Based on these measurements the clients
are connected by switch <b>moon</b> to the "allow" and "isolate" VLANs, respectively.
