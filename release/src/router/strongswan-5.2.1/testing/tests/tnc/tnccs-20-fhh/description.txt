The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the clients doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> via the <b>TNCCS 2.0 </b> client-server interface
compliant with <b>RFC 5793 PB-TNC</b>. The Dummy IMC and IMV from the 
<a href="http://trust.inform.fh-hannover.de/joomla/index.php/projects/tncfhh" target="popup">
<b>TNC@FHH</b></a> project are used which communicate over a proprietary protocol.
<p>
<b>carol</b> passes the health test and <b>dave</b> fails. Based on these measurements the
clients are connected by gateway <b>moon</b> to the "rw-allow" and "rw-isolate" subnets,
respectively.
