The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the clients doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
<p/>
In a next step the <b>RFC 7171 PT-EAP</b> transport protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel 
to determine the state of <b>carol</b>'s and <b>dave</b>'s operating system via the <b>IF-TNCCS 2.0</b>
client-server interface compliant with <b>RFC 5793 PB-TNC</b>. The OS and Attestation IMCs
exchange PA-TNC attributes with the OS IMV via the <b>IF-M 1.0</b> measurement protocol
defined by <b>RFC 5792 PA-TNC</b>.
<p/>
<b>carol</b> sends information on her operating system consisting of the PA-TNC attributes
<em>Product Information</em>, <em>String Version</em>, <em>Numeric Version</em>,
<em>Operational Status</em>, <em>Forwarding Enabled</em>, <em>Factory Default Password Enabled</em>
and <em>Device ID</em> up-front, whereas <b>dave</b> must be prompted by the IMV to do so via an
<em>Attribute Request</em> PA-TNC attribute. <b>carol</b> is then prompted to send a list of
installed packages using the <em>Installed Packages</em> PA-TNC attribute. Since <b>dave</b>
successfully connected to the VPN gateway shortly before, no new list of installed packages is
requested again but because IP forwarding is enabled <b>dave</b> receives a corresponding
<em>Remediation Instructions</em> PA-TNC attribute.
<p>
<b>carol</b> passes the health test and <b>dave</b> fails. Based on these assessments
which are communicated to the IMCs using the <em>Assessment Result</em> PA-TNC attribute,
the clients are connected by gateway <b>moon</b> to the "rw-allow" and "rw-isolate"
subnets, respectively.
