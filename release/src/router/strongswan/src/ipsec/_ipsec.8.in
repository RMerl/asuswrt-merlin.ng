.SH NAME
.
@IPSEC_SCRIPT@ \- invoke IPsec utilities
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.SY @IPSEC_SCRIPT@
.I command
.RI [ arguments ]
.RI [ options ]
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The
.B @IPSEC_SCRIPT@
utility invokes any of several utilities involved in controlling and monitoring
the IPsec encryption/authentication system, running the specified \fIcommand\fP
with the specified \fIarguments\fP and \fIoptions\fP as if it had been invoked
directly. This largely eliminates possible name collisions with other software,
and also permits some centralized services.
.P
All the commands described in this manual page are built-in and are used to
control and monitor IPsec connections as well as the IKE daemon.
.P
For other commands
.I @IPSEC_SCRIPT@
supplies the invoked
.I command
with a suitable PATH environment variable,
and also provides the environment variables listed under
.IR ENVIRONMENT .
.
.SS CONTROL COMMANDS
.
.TP
.BI "start [" "starter options" ]
calls
.B "starter"
which in turn parses \fIipsec.conf\fR and starts the IKE daemon \fIcharon\fR.
.
.TP
.B "update"
sends a \fIHUP\fR signal to
.BR "starter"
which in turn determines any changes in \fIipsec.conf\fR
and updates the configuration on the running IKE daemon \fIcharon\fR.
.
.TP
.B "reload"
sends a \fIUSR1\fR signal to
.BR "starter"
which in turn reloads the whole configuration of the running IKE daemon
\fIcharon\fR based on the actual \fIipsec.conf\fR.
.
.TP
.B "restart"
is equivalent to
.B "stop"
followed by
.B "start"
after a guard of 2 seconds.
.
.TP
.B "stop"
terminates all IPsec connections and stops the IKE daemon \fIcharon\fR
by sending a \fITERM\fR signal to
.BR "starter".
.
.TP
.BI "up " name
tells the IKE daemon to start up connection \fIname\fP.
.
.TP
.BI "down " name
tells the IKE daemon to terminate connection \fIname\fP.
.
.TP
.BI "down " name{n}
terminates IKEv1 Quick Mode and IKEv2 CHILD SA instance \fIn\fP of
connection \fIname\fP.
.
.TP

terminates all IKE SA instances with clients having virtual IPs in the range
.IR start - end .
.
.TP
.BI "route " name

for connection \fIname\fP. The first payload packet matching the IPsec policy
will automatically trigger an IKE connection setup.

.BI "unroute " name
remove the IPsec policy in the kernel for connection \fIname\fP.
