# The Versatile IKE Control Interface (VICI) protocol #

The vici _[ˈvitʃi]_ plugin implements the server side of an IPC protocol to
configure, monitor and control the IKE daemon charon. It uses request/response
and event messages to communicate over a reliable stream based transport.

## Transport protocol ##

To provide the service, the plugin opens a listening socket using a reliable,
stream based transport. charon relies on the different stream service
abstractions provided by libstrongswan, such as TCP and UNIX sockets.

A client connects to this service to access functionality. It may send an
arbitrary number of packets over the connection before closing it.

To exchange data, the transport protocol is segmented into byte sequences.
Each byte sequence is prefixed by a 32-bit length header in network order,
followed by the data. The maximum segment length is currently limited to 512KB
of data, and the length field contains the length of the data only, not
including the length field itself.

The order of byte sequences must be strict, byte sequences must arrive in the
same order as sent.

## Packet layer ##

Within the byte sequences defined by the transport layer, both the client
and the server can exchange packets. The type of packet defines its structure
and purpose. The packet type is a 8-bit identifier, and is the first byte
in a transport layer byte sequence. The length of the packet is given by the
transport layer.

While a packet type may define the format of the wrapped data freely, currently
all types either contain a name, a message or both. The following packet types
are currently defined:

* _CMD_REQUEST = 0_: A named request message
* _CMD_RESPONSE = 1_: An unnamed response message for a request
* _CMD_UNKNOWN = 2_: An unnamed response if requested command is unknown
* _EVENT_REGISTER = 3_: A named event registration request
* _EVENT_UNREGISTER = 4_: A named event deregistration request
* _EVENT_CONFIRM = 5_: An unnamed response for successful event (de-)registration
* _EVENT_UNKNOWN = 6_: A unnamed response if event (de-)registration failed
* _EVENT = 7_: A named event message

For packets having a named type, after the packet type an 8-bit length header
of the name follows, indicating the string length in bytes of the name tag, not
including the length field itself. The name is an ASCII string that is not
null-terminated.

The rest of the packet forms the exchanged message, the length is determined
by the transport byte sequence length, subtracting the packet type and
the optional name tag in some messages.

### Commands ###

Commands are currently always requested by the client. The server replies with
a response, or with a CMD_UNKNOWN failure message to let the client know
that it does not have a handler for such a command. There is no sequence number
to associate responses to requests, so only one command can be active at
a time on a single connection.

### Events ###

To receive event messages, the client explicitly registers for events by name,
and also unregisters if it does not want to receive events of the named kind
anymore. The server confirms event registration using EVENT_CONFIRM, or
indicates that there is no such event source with EVENT_UNKNOWN.

Events may get raised at any time while registered, even during an active
request command. This mechanism is used to feed continuous data during a request,
for example.

## Message format ##

The defined packet types optionally wrap a message with additional data.
Messages are currently used in CMD_REQUEST/CMD_RESPONSE, and in EVENT packets.
A message uses a hierarchical tree of sections. Each section (or the implicit
root section) contains an arbitrary set of key/value pairs, lists and
sub-sections. The length of a message is not part of the message itself, but
the wrapping layer, usually calculated from the transport byte sequence length.

The message encoding consists of a sequence of elements. Each element starts
with the element type, optionally followed by an element name and/or an element
value. Currently the following message element types are defined:

* _SECTION_START = 1_: Begin a new section having a name
* _SECTION_END = 2_: End a previously started section
* _KEY_VALUE = 3_: Define a value for a named key in the current section
* _LIST_START = 4_: Begin a named list for list items
* _LIST_ITEM = 5_: Define an unnamed item value in the current list
* _LIST_END = 6_: End a previously started list

Types are encoded as 8-bit values. Types having a name (SECTION_START,
KEY_VALUE and LIST_START) have an ASCII string following the type, which itself
uses an 8-bit length header. The string must not be null-terminated, the string
length does not include the length field itself.

Types having a value (KEY_VALUE and LIST_ITEM) have a raw blob sequence,
prefixed with a 16-bit network order length. The blob follows the type or the
name tag if available, the length defined by the length field does not include
the length field itself.

The interpretation of any value is not defined by the message format; it can
take arbitrary blobs. The application may specify types for specific keys, such
as strings or integer representations. The vici plugin currently uses
non-null terminated strings as values only; numbers get encoded as strings.

### Sections ###

Sections may be opened in the implicit root section, or any previously section.
They can be nested to arbitrary levels. A SECTION_END marker always closes
the last opened section; SECTION_START and SECTION_END items must be balanced
in a valid message.

### Key/Values ###

Key/Value pair elements may appear in the implicit root section or any explicit
sub-section at any level. Key names must be unique in the current section, use
lists to define multiple values for a key. Key/values may not appear in lists,
use a sub-section instead.

### Lists ###

Lists may appear at the same locations as Key/Values, and may not be nested.
Only a single list may be opened at the same time, and all lists must be closed
in valid messages. After opening a list, only list items may appear before the
list closing element. Empty lists are allowed, list items may appear within
lists only.

### Encoding example ###

Consider the following structure using pseudo-markup for this example:

	key1 = value1
	section1 = {
		sub-section = {
			key2 = value2
		}
		list1 = [ item1, item2 ]
	}

The example above represents a valid tree structure, that gets encoded as
the following C array:

	char msg[] = {
		/* key1 = value1 */
		3, 4,'k','e','y','1', 0,6,'v','a','l','u','e','1',
		/* section1 */
		1, 8,'s','e','c','t','i','o','n','1',
		/* sub-section */
		1, 11,'s','u','b','-','s','e','c','t','i','o','n',
		/* key2 = value2 */
		3, 4,'k','e','y','2', 0,6,'v','a','l','u','e','2',
		/* sub-section end */
		2,
		/* list1 */
		4, 5, 'l','i','s','t','1',
		/* item1 */
		5, 0,5,'i','t','e','m','1',
		/* item2 */
		5, 0,5,'i','t','e','m','2',
		/* list1 end */
		6,
		/* section1 end */
		2,
	};

## Client-initiated commands ##

Based on the packet layer, VICI implements commands requested by the client
and responded to by the server using named _CMD_REQUEST_ and _CMD_RESPONSE_
packets wrapping messages. The request message may contain command arguments,
the response message the reply.

Some commands use response streaming, that is, a request triggers a series of
events to consecutively stream data to the client before the response message
completes the stream. A client must register for the appropriate event to
receive the stream, and unregister after the response has been received.

The following client issued commands with the appropriate command input and
output messages are currently defined:

# libvici C client library #

libvici is the reference implementation of a C client library implementing
the vici protocol. It builds upon libstrongswan, but provides a stable API
to implement client applications in the C programming language. libvici uses
the libstrongswan thread pool to deliver event messages asynchronously.

## Connecting to the daemon ##

This example shows how to connect to the daemon using the default URI, and
then perform proper cleanup:

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <errno.h>
	#include <string.h>

	#include <libvici.h>

	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
		vici_conn_t *conn;
		int ret = 0;

		vici_init();
		conn = vici_connect(NULL);
		if (conn)
		{
			/* do stuff */
			vici_disconnect(conn);
		}
		else
		{
			ret = errno;
			fprintf(stderr, "connecting failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		}
		vici_deinit();
		return ret;
	}

## A simple client request ##

In the following example, a simple _version_ request is issued to the daemon
and the result is printed:

	int get_version(vici_conn_t *conn)
	{
		vici_req_t *req;
		vici_res_t *res;
		int ret = 0;

		req = vici_begin("version");
		res = vici_submit(req, conn);
		if (res)
		{
			printf("%s %s (%s, %s, %s)\n",
				vici_find_str(res, "", "daemon"),
				vici_find_str(res, "", "version"),
				vici_find_str(res, "", "sysname"),
				vici_find_str(res, "", "release"),
				vici_find_str(res, "", "machine"));
			vici_free_res(res);
		}
		else
		{
			ret = errno;
			fprintf(stderr, "version request failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		}
		return ret;
	}

## A request with event streaming and callback parsing ##

In this more advanced example, the _list-conns_ command is used to stream
loaded connections with the _list-conn_ event. The event message is parsed
with a simple callback to print the connection name:

	int conn_cb(void *null, vici_res_t *res, char *name)
	{
		printf("%s\n", name);
		return 0;
	}

	void list_cb(void *null, char *name, vici_res_t *res)
	{
		if (vici_parse_cb(res, conn_cb, NULL, NULL, NULL) != 0)
		{
			fprintf(stderr, "parsing failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		}
	}

	int list_conns(vici_conn_t *conn)
	{
		vici_req_t *req;
		vici_res_t *res;
		int ret = 0;

		if (vici_register(conn, "list-conn", list_cb, NULL) == 0)
		{
			req = vici_begin("list-conns");
			res = vici_submit(req, conn);
			if (res)
			{
				vici_free_res(res);
			}
			else
			{
				ret = errno;
				fprintf(stderr, "request failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
			}
			vici_register(conn, "list-conn", NULL, NULL);
		}
		else
		{
			ret = errno;
			fprintf(stderr, "registration failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		}
		return ret;
	}

## API documentation ##

More information about the libvici API is available in the _libvici.h_ header
file or the generated Doxygen documentation.

# vici ruby gem #

The _vici ruby gem_ is a pure ruby implementation of the VICI protocol to
implement client applications. It is provided in the _ruby_ subdirectory, and
gets built and installed if strongSwan has been _./configure_'d with
_--enable-vici_ and _--enable-ruby-gems_.

The _Connection_ class from the _Vici_ module provides the high level interface,
the underlying classes are usually not required to build ruby applications
using VICI. The _Connection_ class provides methods for the supported VICI
commands and an event listening mechanism.

To represent the VICI message data tree, the gem converts the binary encoding
to ruby data types. The _Connection_ class takes and returns ruby objects for
the exchanged message data:
 * Sections get encoded as Hash, containing other sections as Hash, or
 * Key/Values, where the values are Strings as Hash values
 * Lists get encoded as Arrays with String values
Non-String values that are not a Hash nor an Array get converted with .to_s
during encoding.

## Connecting to the daemon ##

To create a connection to the daemon, a socket can be passed to the
_Connection_ constructor. If none is passed, a default Unix socket at
_/var/run/charon.vici_ is used:

	require "vici"
	require "socket"

	v = Vici::Connection.new(UNIXSocket.new("/var/run/charon.vici"))

## A simple client request ##

An example to print the daemon version information is as simple as:

	x = v.version
	puts "%s %s (%s, %s, %s)" % [
		x["daemon"], x["version"], x["sysname"], x["release"], x["machine"]
	]

## A request with closure invocation ##

The _Connection_ class takes care of event streaming by invoking a closure
for each event. The following example lists all loaded connections using the
_list-conns_ command and implicitly the _list-conn_ event:

	v.list_conns { |conn|
		conn.each { |key, value|
			puts key
		}
	}

## API documentation ##

code or the generated documentation.

# vici Python egg #

The _vici Python egg_ is a pure Python implementation of the VICI protocol to
implement client applications. It is provided in the _python_ subdirectory, and
gets built and installed if strongSwan has been _./configure_'d with
_--enable-vici_ and _--enable-python-eggs_.

The _vici_ module provides a _Session()_ constructor for a high level interface,
the underlying classes are usually not required to build Python applications
using VICI. The _Session_ class provides methods for the supported VICI
commands.

To represent the VICI message data tree, the library converts the binary
encoding to Python data types. The _Session_ class takes and returns Python
objects for the exchanged message data:
 * Sections get encoded as OrderedDict, containing other sections, or
 * Key/Values, where the values are strings as dictionary values
 * Lists get encoded as Python Lists with string values
Values that do not conform to Python dict or list get converted to strings using
str().

## Connecting to the daemon ##

To create a connection to the daemon, a socket can be passed to the _Session_
constructor. If none is passed, a default Unix socket at _/var/run/charon.vici_
is used:

	import vici
	import socket

	s = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX)
	s.connect("/var/run/charon.vici")
	v = vici.Session(s)

## A simple client request ##

An example to print the daemon version information is as simple as:

	ver = v.version()

	print "{daemon} {version} ({sysname}, {release}, {machine})".format(**ver)

## A request with response iteration ##

The _Session_ class returns an iterable Python generator for streamed events to
continuously stream objects to the caller. The following example lists all
loaded connections using the _list-conns_ command and implicitly the _list-conn_
event:

	for conn in v.list_conns():
		for key in conn:
			print key

Please note that if the returned generator is not iterated completely, it must
be closed using _close()_. This is implicitly done when breaking from a loop,
but an explicit call may be required when directly iterating the generator with
_next()_.

## Sorting in dictionaries ##

In VICI, in some message trees the order of objects in dictionary matters. In
contrast to ruby Hashes, Python dictionaries do not preserve order of added
objects. It is therefore recommended to use OrderedDicts instead of the default
dictionaries. Objects returned by the library use OrderedDicts.

## API documentation ##

For more details about the Python egg refer to the comments in the Python source
code.

# Vici::Session Perl CPAN module #

The _Vici::Session Perl CPAN module_ is a pure Perl implementation of the VICI
protocol to implement client applications. It is provided in the _perl_
subdirectory, and gets built and installed if strongSwan has been
 _./configure_'d with_--enable-vici_ and _--enable-perl-cpan_.

The _Vici::Session_ module provides a _new()_ constructor for a high level
interface, the underlying _Vici::Packet_ and _Vici::Transport_ classes are
usually not required to build Perl applications using VICI. The _Vici::Session_
class provides methods for the supported VICI commands. The auxiliary
 _Vici::Message_ class is used to encode configuration parameters sent to
the daemon and decode data returned by the daemon.

## Connecting to the daemon ##

	use IO::Socket::UNIX;
	use Vici::Session;
	use Vici::Message;

	my $socket = IO::Socket::UNIX->new(
			Type => SOCK_STREAM,
			Peer => '/var/run/charon.vici',
	) or die "Vici socket: $!";

	my $session = Vici::Session->new($socket);

## A simple client request ##

An example to print the daemon version information is as simple as:

	my $version = $session->version()->hash();

	foreach my $key ('daemon', 'version', 'sysname', 'release', 'machine' ) {
		print $version->{$key}, " ";
	}

The _Vici::Session_ methods are explained in the perl/Vici-Session/README.pod
document.
