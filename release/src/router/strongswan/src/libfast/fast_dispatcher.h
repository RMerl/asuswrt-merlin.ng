 * FastCGI Application Server w/ templates.
 *
 * Libfast is a framework to write web applications in an MVC fashion. It uses
 * the ClearSilver template engine and communicates through FastCGI with
 * the webserver. It is multithreaded and really fast.
 *
 * The application has a global context and a session context. The global
 * context is accessed from all sessions simultaneously and therefore
 * needs to be threadsafe. Often a database wrapper is the global context.
 * The session context is instantiated per session. Sessions are managed
 * automatically through session cookies. The session context is kept alive
 * until the session times out. It must implement the context_t interface and
 * a #fast_context_constructor_t is needed to create instances. To each session,
 * a set of controllers gets instantiated. The controller instances are per
 * session, so you can hold private data for each user.
 * Controllers need to implement the controller_t interface and need a
 * #fast_controller_constructor_t function to create instances.
 *
 * A small example shows how to set up libfast:
 * @code
	fast_fast_dispatcher_t *dispatcher;
	your_global_context_implementation_t *global;

	global = initialize_your_global_context();

	dispatcher = fast_dispatcher_create(NULL, FALSE, 180,
			(context_constructor_t)your_session_context_create, global);
	dispatcher->add_controller(dispatcher, your_controller1_create, param1);
	dispatcher->add_controller(dispatcher, your_controller2_create, param2);

	dispatcher->run(dispatcher, 20);

	dispatcher->waitsignal(dispatcher);

	dispatcher->destroy(dispatcher);
	global->destroy();
