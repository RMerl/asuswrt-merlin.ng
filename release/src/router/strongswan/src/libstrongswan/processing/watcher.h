 * Callback function to register for file descriptor events.

 * Monitoring of fd is temporarily suspended to avoid additional events while
 * it is processed asynchronously. To allow concurrent events, one can quickly
 * process it (using a read/write) and return from the callback. This will
 * re-enable the event, while the data read can be processed in another
 * asynchronous job.
 *
 * On Linux, even if select() marks an FD as "ready", a subsequent read/write
 * can block. It is therefore highly recommended to use non-blocking I/O
 * and handle EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK gracefully.
