.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
This sub-command of
.BR pki (1)
sends a PKCS#10 certificate request via HTTPS to a server using the Enrollment
over Secure Transport (EST) Protocol (RFC 7030). After successful authorization
which with manual authentication requires periodic polling by the enrollment
client, the EST server returns an X.509 certificate signed by the CA.

Before the expiry of the current certificate, a new client certificate based on
a fresh private key can be requested, using the old certificate and the old
key for automatic TLS client authentication with the EST server.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Print usage information with a summary of the available options.
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-debug " level
Set debug level, default: 1.
.TP
.BI "\-+, \-\-options " file
Read command line options from \fIfile\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-u, \-\-url " url
URL of the EST server.
.TP
.BI "\-l, \-\-label " label
Label in the EST server path.
.TP
.BI "\-i, \-\-in " file
PKCS#10 certificate request. If not given, the certificate request is read from
\fISTDIN\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-C, \-\-cacert " file
CA certificate in the trust chain used for EST TLS server signature verification
or in the trust chain to verify the client certificate issued by the CA.
Can be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-cert " file
Client certificate to be renewed.
.TP
.BI "\-X, \-\-certid " hex
Smartcard or TPM 2.0 client certificate object handle.
.TP
.BI "\-k, \-\-key " file
Client private key to be replaced.
.TP
.BI "\-x, \-\-keyid " hex
Smartcard or TPM 2.0 client private key object handle.
.TP
.BI "\-p, \-\-userpass " username:password
Optional username:password that may be used for HTTP basic authentication.
.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-interval " time
Poll interval in seconds, defaults to \fI60s\fR. This value might get overridden
by the
.B retry-after
header in the HTTP 202 reply from the EST server.
.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-maxpolltime " time
Maximum poll time in seconds, defaults to \fI0\fR which means unlimited polling.
.TP
.BI "\-f, \-\-outform " encoding
Encoding of the created certificate file. Either \fIder\fR (ASN.1 DER) or
\fIpem\fR (Base64 PEM), defaults to \fIder\fR.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.
To save some typing work the following command line options are stored in a
\fIest.opt\fR file:
.PP
.EX
\-\-url https://pki.strongswan.org:8443
\-\-cacert tlsca.crt
\-\-cacert tlsca-1.crt
\-\-cacert myca.crt
\-\-cacert myca-1.crt
.EE
.PP
.B NOTE:
For a successful HTTPS connection, trust must be established into the EST server
certificate. The TLS trust chain including the root CA certificate and
optionally intermediate CA certificates must be given using multiple
.B --cacert
options.
.P
The
.B --cacert
option must also be used to be able to verify the received client certificate
issued by the CA. This second trust chain might be identical to the TLS trust
chain (if the EST server is using a TLS server certificate issued by its own CA)
or might be totally different, e.g. if a Let's Encrypt EST server certificate is
used.
.P
With the following command, an X.509 certificate signed by the intermediate CA is
requested from an EST server based on a PKCS#10 certificate request:
.PP
.EX
pki \-\-options est.opt --in moonReq.der > moonCert.der

.EE
.PP
This certificate can be renewed some time before it expires with the command:
.PP
.EX
pki \-\-options est.opt --in moonReqNew.der --cert moonCert.der --key moonKey.der > moonCertNew.der

.EE
.PP
If the private key and the certificate of the client is stored in a TPM 2.0, the
renewal can be done with the following options:
.PP
.EX
pki \-\-options est.opt --in moonReqNew.der --certid 0x01800004 --keyid 0x81010004 > moonCertNew.der
