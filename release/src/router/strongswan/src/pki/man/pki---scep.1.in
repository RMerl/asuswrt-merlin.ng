.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
This sub-command of
.BR pki (1)
sends a PKCS#10 certificate request in an encrypted and signed PKCS#7 container
via HTTP to a SCEP server using the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol
(RFC 8894). After successful authorization which with manual authentication
requires periodic polling by the enrollment client, the SCEP server returns an
X.509 certificate signed by the CA.

Before the expiry of the current certificate, a new client certificate based on
a fresh RSA private key can be requested, using the old certificate and the old
key for automatic authentication with the SCEP server.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Print usage information with a summary of the available options.
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-debug " level
Set debug level, default: 1.
.TP
.BI "\-+, \-\-options " file
Read command line options from \fIfile\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-u, \-\-url " url
URL of the SCEP server.
.TP
.BI "\-i, \-\-in " file
RSA private key. If not given the key is read from \fISTDIN\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-d, \-\-dn " distinguished-name
Subject distinguished name (DN). Required unless \-\-cert is given.
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-san " subjectAltName
subjectAltName extension to include in request. Can be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI "\-P, \-\-profile " profile
Certificate profile name to be included in the certificate request. Can be any
UTF8 string. Supported e.g. by the
.B openxpki
SCEP server with profiles (\fIpc-client\fR, \fItls-server\fR, etc.) that are
translated into corresponding Extended Key Usage (EKU) flags in the generated
X.509 certificate.
.TP
.BI "\-p, \-\-password " password
The challengePassword to include in the certificate request.
.TP
.BI "\-e, \-\-cacert-enc " file
CA or RA certificate for encryption
.TP
.BI "\-s, \-\-cacert-sig " file
CA certificate for signature verification
.TP
.BI "\-C, \-\-cacert " file
Additional CA certificate in the trust chain used for signature verification.
Can be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-cert " file
Client certificate to be renewed.
.TP
.BI "\-k, \-\-key " file
Client RSA private key to be replaced.
.TP
.BI "\-E, \-\-cipher " cipher
Cipher used for symmetric encryption. Either \fIaes\fR (the default) or \fIdes3\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-g, \-\-digest " digest
Digest to use for signature creation. One of \fIsha256\fR (the default),
\fIsha384\fR, \fIsha512\fR, or \fIsha1\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-R, \-\-rsa\-padding " padding
Padding to use for RSA signatures. Either \fIpkcs1\fR (the default) or \fIpss\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-interval " time
Poll interval in seconds, defaults to \fI60s\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-maxpolltime " time
Maximum poll time in seconds, defaults to \fI0\fR which means unlimited polling.
.TP
.BI "\-f, \-\-outform " encoding
Encoding of the created certificate file. Either \fIder\fR (ASN.1 DER) or
\fIpem\fR (Base64 PEM), defaults to \fIder\fR.

To save some typing work the following command line options are stored in a
\fIscep.opt\fR file:

With the following command, an X.509 certificate signed by the intermediate CA is
requested from a SCEP server:
