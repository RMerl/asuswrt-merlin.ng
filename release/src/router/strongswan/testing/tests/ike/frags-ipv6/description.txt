The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up an IPv6 connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b> using the <b>IKEv1</b> and <b>IKEv2</b> key exchange
protocol, respectively. The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>.
<b>dave</b> advertises the support of the IKEv2 fragmentation protocol defined in
<b>RFC 7383</b> which prevents the IP fragmentation of the IKEv2 messages carrying
large X.509 certificates whereas <b>carol</b> announces support of non-standardized
IKEv1 fragmentation. 
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPv6 IPsec tunnels, the updown script
automatically inserts ip6tables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
