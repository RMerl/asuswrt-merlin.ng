The VPN gateway <b>moon</b> grants access to the hosts <b>alice</b> and
<b>venus</b> to anyone presenting a certificate belonging to a trust chain anchored
in the strongSwan Root CA.  The hosts <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> have certificates
from the intermediate Research CA and Sales CA, respectively. Responder <b>moon</b>
does not possess copies of the Research and Sales CA certificates and must therefore
request them from the initiators <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b>, respectively.
