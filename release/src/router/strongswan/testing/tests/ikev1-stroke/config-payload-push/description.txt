The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The gateway pushes <b>virtual IP</b> addresses to <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b>via the IKEv1
Mode Config protocol in <b>push</b> mode.
<b>moon</b> explicitly assigns a specific virtual IP to each of the two clients.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, <b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic. In order to test the
tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway
<b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two pings will be the virtual IPs <b>10.3.0.1</b>
and <b>10.3.0.2</b>, respectively.
