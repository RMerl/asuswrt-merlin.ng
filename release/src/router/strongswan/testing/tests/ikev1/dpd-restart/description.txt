The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up an IPsec tunnel connection to the gateway
<b>moon</b>. Both end points activate <b>Dead Peer Detection</b> (DPD) with a
polling interval of 10 s. When the network connectivity between <b>carol</b>
and <b>moon</b> is forcefully disrupted, <b>moon</b> clears the connection after
some unsuccessful retransmits whereas <b>carol</b> also takes down the connection
but immediately tries to reconnect which succeeds as soon as the connection
becomes available again.
