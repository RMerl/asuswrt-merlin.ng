The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The IKEv1 main mode authentication is based on
<b>X.509 certificates</b>.
On the gateway two connections with differing parameters are defined:
One for <b>carol</b> using the IKE proposal <b>aes128-sha256-modp3072</b>
allowing to reach host <b>alice</b> and one for <b>dave</b> using
the IKE proposal <b>3des-sha1-modp2048</b> allowing to reach host <b>venus</b>.
<p/>
Since the IP addresses of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> are not known
to <b>moon</b> the matching connection definition can only be determined
by <b>moon</b> after the peer identities have been received.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, <b>carol</b> pings the
client <b>alice</b> and <b>dave</b> the client <b>venus</b> lying in two different
subnets behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
