The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each
to gateway <b>moon</b> using <b>IKEv1 Aggressive Mode</b>. The authentication
is based on distinct <b>pre-shared keys</b> and <b>Fully Qualified Domain Names</b>.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown-script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both
<b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
