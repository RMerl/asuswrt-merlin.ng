The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The IKEv1 main mode authentication is based on
<b>pre-shared keys</b> and <b>IPv4 address</b> identities.
On the gateway two connections with differing parameters are defined:
One for peers from the <b>192.168.0.96/28</b> subnet and one for peers from
the range <b>192.168.0.150-192.168.0.200</b>.
<p/>
On the gateway for different shared keys are defined for the following
hierarchcal peer address ranges: <b>0.0.0.0/0 0::0/0</b>,
<b>192.168.0.96/28</b>, <b>192.168.0.150-192.168.0.200</b> and
<b>192.168.0.200</b>. Client <b>carol</b> uses the first and client <b>dave</b>
the fourth PSK.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, <b>carol</b> pings the
client <b>alice</b> and <b>dave</b> the client <b>venus</b> lying in two different
subnets behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
