The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on RSA signatures using X.509 certificates followed by extended
authentication (<b>XAUTH</b>) of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> based on user names defined
by the <b>xauth_id</b> parameter carol and dave, respectively and corresponding user passwords
defined and stored in the secrets section of swanctl.conf.
Next both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv1 Mode Config
protocol by using the <b>vips = 0.0.0.0</b> parameter.
<p>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, the updown-script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping the client
<b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
