The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on RSA signatures using X.509 certificates followed by extended
authentication (<b>XAUTH</b>) of <b>carol</b> based on a user name equal to the <b>IKEv1</b> identity
carol@strongswan.org and a user password defined and stored by <b>carol</b> in  the secrets
section of swanctl.conf.
<p/>
Gateway <b>moon</b> delegates the verification of <b>carol</b>'s XAUTH user credentials to
the RADIUS server <b>alice</b>.
<p>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, the updown-script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, <b>carol</b> pings the client <b>alice</b>
behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
