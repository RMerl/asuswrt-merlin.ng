The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on RSA signatures using X.509 certificates followed by extended
authentication (<b>XAUTH</b>) of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> based on user names equal to
the <b>IKEv1 identities</b> carol@strongswan.org and dave@strongswan.org, respectively and
corresponding user passwords defined and stored in the secrets section of swanctl.conf.
<p>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, the updown-script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping the client
<b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
