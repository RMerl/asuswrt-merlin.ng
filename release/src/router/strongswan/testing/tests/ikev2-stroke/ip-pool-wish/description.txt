The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request the same <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2
configuration payload by using the <b>leftsourceip=PH_IP_CAROL1</b> parameter. On a first-come,
first-served basis, <b>carol</b> gets <b>PH_IP_CAROL1</b> from the simple address pool managed
by gateway <b>moon</b> and <b>dave</b> gets the next free address <b>PH_IP_DAVE1</b>
from the pool. 
<p>
<b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass
the tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two
pings will be the virtual IPs <b>carol1</b> and <b>dave1</b>, respectively.
