A connection between the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> is set up.
The authentication is based on <b>raw RSA keys</b> in Base64-encoded RFC 3110 DNSKEY format.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, <b>leftfirewall=yes</b>
automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, client <b>alice</b> behind gateway <b>moon</b>
pings client <b>bob</b> located behind gateway <b>sun</b>.
