The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
<b>carol</b> uses the <i>Extensible Authentication Protocol</i>
in association with an  <i>MD5</i> challenge and response protocol
(<b>EAP-MD5</b>) to authenticate against the gateway. The EAP identity and password
of the user is kept in <b>ipsec.secrets</b> on the gateway <b>moon</b> and 
is entered interactively on the client <b>carol</b> using the command
<b>ipsec stroke user-creds home carol "Ar3etTnp"</b>.
Gateway <b>moon</b> additionally uses an <b>RSA signature</b> to authenticate itself
against <b>carol</b>.
