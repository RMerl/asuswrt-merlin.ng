The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The strong mutual authentication is based on <b>EAP-PEAP</b> only (without a separate IKEv2
authentication) with the gateway being authenticated by a server certificate during the
EAP-TLS tunnel setup (phase1 of EAP-PEAP). This tunnel protects the ensuing weak client
authentication based on <b>EAP-MD5</b> (phase2 of EAP-PEAP).
<p/>
With the setting <b>charon.plugins.eap-peap.phase2_piggyback = yes</b> the server <b>moon</b>
initiates phase2 of the EAP-PEAP protocol by piggybacking a tunneled EAP Identity request
right onto the TLS Finished message. Client <b>carol</b> presents the correct MD5 password
and succeeds whereas client <b>dave</b> chooses the wrong password and fails.
