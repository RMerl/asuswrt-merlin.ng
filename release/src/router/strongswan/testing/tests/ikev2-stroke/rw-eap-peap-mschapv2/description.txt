The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The strong mutual authentication is based on <b>EAP-PEAP</b> only (without a separate IKEv2
authentication) with the gateway being authenticated by a server certificate during the
EAP-TLS tunnel setup (phase1 of EAP-PEAP). This tunnel protects the ensuing weak client
authentication based on <b>EAP-MSCHAPv2</b> (phase2 of EAP-PEAP).
<p/>
Client <b>carol</b> presents the correct MSCHAPv2 password and succeeds whereas client
<b>dave</b> chooses the wrong password and fails.
