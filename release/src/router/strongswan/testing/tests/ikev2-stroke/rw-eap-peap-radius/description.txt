The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
At the outset the gateway authenticates itself to the clients by sending an IKEv2
<b>RSA signature</b> accompanied by a certificate.
<b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then set up an <b>EAP-PEAP</b> tunnel each via <b>moon</b> to
the FreeRADIUS server <b>alice</b> authenticated by an X.509 AAA certificate.
The strong EAP-PEAP tunnel protects the ensuing weak client authentication based on <b>EAP-MD5</b>.
<b>carol</b> presents the correct MD5 password and succeeds whereas <b>dave</b> chooses the
wrong password and fails.
