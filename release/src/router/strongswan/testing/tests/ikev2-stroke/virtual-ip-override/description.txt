The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> both set up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The roadwarriors each unilaterally define a static virtual IP using the <b>leftsourceip</b>
parameter. In order to detect potential address conflicts, the roadwarriors send
their virtual IPs embedded in a configuration payload to <b>moon</b> for verification.
In our scenario <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> both request the same IP address.
These requests are overridden by gateway <b>moon</b> which assigns a
distinct virtual IP to each road warrior.
