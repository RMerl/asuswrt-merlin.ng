The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> both set up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The roadwarriors each unilaterally define a static virtual IP using the <b>leftsourceip</b>
parameter. In order to detect potential address conflicts, the roadwarriors send
their virtual IPs embedded in a configuration payload to <b>moon</b> for verification.
In our scenario <b>moon</b> accepts the address choices thus allowing <b>carol</b> and
<b>dave</b> to install their respective virtual IP addresses.
<p>
In order to test the tunnels both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping the client <b>alice</b>
behind the gateway <b>moon</b> as well as the inner interface of the gateway.
The latter ping requires access to the gateway itself which is granted by the
directive <b>lefthostaccess=yes</b>. The source IP of the two pings will be the virtual
IP addresses <b>carol1</b> and <b>dave1</b>, respectively. Also thanks to the automatically
configured source route entries, <b>moon</b> is able to ping both roadwarriors by using the
established net-net IPsec tunnels.
