The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway
<b>moon</b> and request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration payload by
using the <b>vips = 0.0.0.0</b> parameter. The virtual addresses assigned to the
clients by gateway <b>moon</b> belong to the subnet 10.1.0.0/16 hidden behind the
gateway so that <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> become full members of this network.
And this thanks to the <b>farp</b> plugin through which <b>moon</b> acts as a proxy
for ARP requests e.g. from <b>alice</b> who wants to ping <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b>.
