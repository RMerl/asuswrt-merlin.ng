The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via IKEv2 configuration
payloads by using the <b>vips = 0.0.0.0</b> parameter.
<b>moon</b> assigns virtual IP addresses from a simple pool defined in the pools section
of swanctl.conf in a monotonously increasing order.
<p>
Using the <b>lookip --lookup</b> command, which communicates with the <b>lookip</b> plugin
via a UNIX socket, information about the assigned virtual IPs is retrieved.
<p>
The updown script automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass
the tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two
pings will be the virtual IPs <b>10.3.0.1</b> and <b>10.3.0.2</b>, respectively.
