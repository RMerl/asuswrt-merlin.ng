#      PLUTO_VERSION
#              indicates  what  version of this interface is being
#              used.  This document describes version  1.1.   This
#              is upwardly compatible with version 1.0.
#
#       PLUTO_VERB
#              specifies the name of the operation to be performed
#              (prepare-host, prepare-client, up-host, up-client,
#              down-host, or down-client).  If the address family
#              for security gateway to security gateway communica-
#              tions is IPv6, then a suffix of -v6 is added to the
#              verb.
#
#       PLUTO_CONNECTION
#              is the name of the  connection  for  which  we  are
#              routing.
#
#       PLUTO_INTERFACE
#              is the name of the ipsec interface to be used.
#
#       PLUTO_REQID
#              is the reqid of the AH|ESP policy
#
#       PLUTO_PROTO
#              is the negotiated IPsec protocol, ah|esp
#
#       PLUTO_IPCOMP
#              is not empty if IPComp was negotiated
#
#       PLUTO_UNIQUEID
#              is the unique identifier of the associated IKE_SA
#
#       PLUTO_ME
#              is the IP address of our host.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_ID
#              is the ID of our host.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_CLIENT
#              is the IP address / count of our client subnet.  If
#              the  client  is  just  the  host,  this will be the
#              host's own IP address / max (where max  is  32  for
#              IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#       PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP
#       PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP4_$i
#       PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP6_$i
#              contains IPv4/IPv6 virtual IP received from a responder,
#              $i enumerates from 1 to the number of IP per address family.
#              PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP is a legacy variable and equal to the first
#              virtual IP, IPv4 or IPv6.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_PROTOCOL
#              is the IP protocol that will be transported.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_PORT
#              is  the  UDP/TCP  port  to  which  the IPsec SA  is
#              restricted on our side.  For ICMP/ICMPv6 this contains the
#              message type, and PLUTO_PEER_PORT the message code.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER
#              is the IP address of our peer.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_ID
#              is the ID of our peer.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT
#              is the IP address / count of the peer's client sub-
#              net.   If the client is just the peer, this will be
#              the peer's own IP address / max (where  max  is  32
#              for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP
#       PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP4_$i
#       PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP6_$i
#              contains IPv4/IPv6 virtual IP sent to an initiator,
#              $i enumerates from 1 to the number of IP per address family.
#              PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP is a legacy variable and equal to the first
#              virtual IP, IPv4 or IPv6.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_PROTOCOL
#              is the IP protocol that will be transported.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_PORT
#              is  the  UDP/TCP  port  to  which  the IPsec SA  is
#              restricted on the peer side.  For ICMP/ICMPv6 this contains the
#              message code, and PLUTO_MY_PORT the message type.
#
#       PLUTO_XAUTH_ID
#              is an optional user ID employed by the XAUTH protocol
#
#       PLUTO_MARK_IN
#              is an optional XFRM mark set on the inbound IPsec SA
#
#       PLUTO_MARK_OUT
#              is an optional XFRM mark set on the outbound IPsec SA
#
#       PLUTO_IF_ID_IN
#              is an optional XFRM interface ID set on the inbound IPsec SA
#
#       PLUTO_IF_ID_OUT
#              is an optional XFRM interface ID set on the outbound IPsec SA
#
#       PLUTO_UDP_ENC
#              contains the remote UDP port in the case of ESP_IN_UDP
#              encapsulation
#
#       PLUTO_DNS4_$i
#       PLUTO_DNS6_$i
#              contains IPv4/IPv6 DNS server attribute received from a
#              responder, $i enumerates from 1 to the number of servers per
#              address family.
