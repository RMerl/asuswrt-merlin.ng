A connection between the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b>
is set up using childless initiation of IKEv2 SAs (RFC 6023).
<p/>
The IKE_SA is established without CHILD_SA during IKE_AUTH. Instead, the
CHILD_SA is created right afterwards with a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, allowing
the use of a separate DH exchange for the first CHILD_SA, which is not possible
if it is created during IKE_AUTH.
<p/>
The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>. Upon the successful
establishment of the IPsec tunnel, the updown script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, client <b>alice</b> behind gateway
<b>moon</b> pings client <b>bob</b> located behind gateway <b>sun</b>.
