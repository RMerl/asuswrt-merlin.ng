By setting <b>strictcrlpolicy=yes</b>, a <b>strict</b> CRL policy is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. 
Client <b>carol</b>'s certificate includes an <b>OCSP URI</b> in an authority information
access extension pointing to <b>winnetou</b>. Gateway <b>moon</b>'s certificate doesn't 
contain any such extensions but <b>carol</b>'s swanctl.conf contains a corresponding
authorities section. With the directive <b>charon.plugins.revocation.enable_ocsp = no</b>
in strongswan.conf all OCSP fetching is disabled and a fallback to CRL fetching occurs. 
<p/>
<b>carol</b> can successfully initiate an IPsec connection to <b>moon</b> since
the status of both certificates is <b>good</b>.
