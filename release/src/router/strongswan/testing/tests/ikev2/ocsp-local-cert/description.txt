By setting <b>revocation = strict</b>, a <b>strict</b> CRL policy is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. The online certificate status
is checked via the OCSP server <b>winnetou</b> which possesses a <b>self-signed</b>
OCSP signer certificate that must be imported locally by the peers into the
<b>/etc/swanctl/x509ocsp/</b> directory.  A strongswan <b>authorities</b> section
in swanctl.conf defines an <b>OCSP URI</b> pointing to <b>winnetou</b>.
<p>
<b>carol</b> can successfully initiate an IPsec connection to <b>moon</b> since
the status of both certificates is <b>good</b>.
