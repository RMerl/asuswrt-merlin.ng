By setting <b>revocation = strict</b>, a <b>strict</b> CRL policy is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. The online certificate status
is checked via the OCSP server <b>winnetou</b> which is sending a normal host
certificate not containing an OCSPSigning extended key usage flag. As a consequence
the OCSP signing certificate is not accepted and the connection setup is aborted.
