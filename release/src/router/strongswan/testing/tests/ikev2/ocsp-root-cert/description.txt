By setting <b>revocation = strict</b>, a <b>strict</b> CRL policy is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. The online certificate status
is checked via the OCSP server <b>winnetou</b> which uses the <b>strongSwan CA</b>'s
private key to sign OCSP responses.
<p/>
<b>carol</b> can successfully initiate an IPsec connection to <b>moon</b> since
the status of both certificates is <b>good</b>.
