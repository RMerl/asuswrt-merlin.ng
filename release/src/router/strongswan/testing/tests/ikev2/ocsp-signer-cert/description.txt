By setting <b>revocation = strict</b>, a <b>strict</b> CRL policy is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. The online certificate status
is checked via the OCSP server <b>winnetou</b> which possesses an OCSP signer certificate
issued by the strongSwan CA. This certificate contains an <b>OCSPSigning</b>
extended key usage flag. <b>carol</b>'s certificate includes an <b>OCSP URI</b>
in an authority information access extension pointing to <b>winnetou</b>.
Therefore no special authorities section information is needed in moon's swanctl.conf.
<p/>
<b>carol</b> can successfully initiate an IPsec connection to <b>moon</b> since
the status of both certificates is <b>good</b>.
