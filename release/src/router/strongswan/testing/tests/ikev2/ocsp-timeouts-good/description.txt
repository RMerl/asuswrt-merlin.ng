This scenario is based on <a href="../ocsp-signer-cert">ikev2/ocsp-signer-cert</a>
and tests the timeouts of the <b>libcurl</b> library used for http-based OCSP fetching
by adding an ocsp_uris entry in <b>moon</b>'s strongswan authority section that cannot
be resolved by <b>DNS</b> and an ocsp_uris entry in <b>carol</b>'s strongswan authority
section on which no OCSP server is listening. Thanks to timeouts the connection can
nevertheless be established successfully by contacting a valid OCSP URI contained in
<b>carol</b>'s certificate.
<p>
As an additional test the OCSP response is delayed by a few seconds in order to check
the correct handling of retransmitted IKE_AUTH messages.
