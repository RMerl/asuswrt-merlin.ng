This scenario is based on <a href="../ocsp-signer-cert">ikev2/ocsp-signer-cert</a>
and tests the timeouts of the <b>libcurl</b> library used for http-based OCSP fetching
by adding two ocsp_uris in <b>moon</b>'s strongswan authorities section on the first
of which no OCSP server is listening and the second URI cannot be resolved by <b>DNS</b>.
Since the certificate status is <b>unknown</b> the connection setup is aborted by
<b>moon</b> with an <b>AUTHORIZATION_FAILED</b> notification sent to <b>carol</b>.
