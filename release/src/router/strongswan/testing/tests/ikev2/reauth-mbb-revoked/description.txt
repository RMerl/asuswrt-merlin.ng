This scenario tests <b>make-before-break reauthentication</b> using overlapping
IKE_SAs by setting the <i>make_before_break</i> strongswan.conf option. The
initiator <b>carol</b> reauthenticates the IKE_SA with host <b>moon</b>, but does
not close the old IKE_SA before the replacement CHILD_SA is in place.
<p/>
Because the responder is always able to install CHILD_SAs before the initiator
is, some traffic sent by the responder over such a CHILD_SA might get dropped by
the initiator (until it also installed the CHILD_SA).  This is particularly
problematic if OCSP/CRL checks are delayed or if they can also be done via the
IPsec tunnel once it's established.  Therefore, online OCSP/CRL checks are
suspended during the reauthentication and done afterwards. This is verified here
by revoking the responder's certificate after the SA got initially established.
