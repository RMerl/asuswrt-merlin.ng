This scenario tests <b>make-before-break reauthentication</b> using overlapping
IKE_SAs by setting the <i>make_before_break</i> strongswan.conf option for
clients using an assigned virtual IP. The initiator <b>carol</b> reauthenticates
the IKE_SA with host <b>moon</b> using <b>ikelifetime=10s</b>, but does not
close the old IKE_SA before the replacement CHILD_SA using the same virtual IP
is in place. A constant ping from <b>carol</b> to client <b>alice</b>
hiding in the subnet behind <b>moon</b> tests if the CHILD_SA works during the
whole procedure.
