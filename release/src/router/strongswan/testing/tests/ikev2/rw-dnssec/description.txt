The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on trustworthy public keys stored as <b>IPSECKEY</b>
resource records in the Domain Name System (DNS) and protected by <b>DNSSEC</b>.
</p>
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration payload
by using the <b>vips = 0.0.0.0</b> parameter.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, the updown-script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test the tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping the client <b>alice</b>
behind the gateway <b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two pings will be the virtual IPs
<b>10.3.0.1</b> and <b>10.3.0.2</b>, respectively.
