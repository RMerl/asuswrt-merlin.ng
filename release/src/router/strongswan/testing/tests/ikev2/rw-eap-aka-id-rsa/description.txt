The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
At the outset the gateway authenticates itself to the client by sending
an IKEv2 <b>digital signature</b> accompanied by an X.509 certificate.
<p/>
Next <b>carol</b> uses the <i>Authentication and Key Agreement</i> (<b>EAP-AKA</b>)
method of the <i>Extensible Authentication Protocol</i> to authenticate herself.
This EAP method used in UMTS, but here a secret defined in <b>swanctl.conf</b>
is used instead of a USIM/(R)UIM device.
<p/>
In addition to her IKEv2 identity <b>carol@strongswan.org</b>, roadwarrior <b>carol</b>
uses the EAP identity <b>carol</b>.
