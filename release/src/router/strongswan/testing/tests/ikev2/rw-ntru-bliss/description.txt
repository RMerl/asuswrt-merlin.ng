The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The key exchange is based on NTRU encryption with a cryptographical strength of 128 bit and
192 bit for <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b>, respectively. Authentication is based on the BLISS
algorithm with strengths 128 bits (BLISS I), 160 bits (BLISS III) and 192 bits (BLISS IV) for
<b>carol</b>, <b>dave</b> and <b>moon</b>, respectively.
<p>
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration payload.
The gateway <b>moon</b> assigns virtual IP addresses from the pool 10.3.0.0/28 in a monotonously
increasing order. 
<p>
The updown script automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass
the tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two
pings will be the virtual IPs <b>carol1</b> and <b>dave1</b>, respectively.
