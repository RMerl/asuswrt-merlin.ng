The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>
and matching RSA private keys stored in the <b>PKCS#8</b> format. <b>moon</b>'s key
is unencrypted, <b>carol</b>'s key is encrypted with the default PKCS#5 v1.5
DES algorithm and <b>dave</b>'s key with the PKCS#5 v2.0 AES-128 algorithm.

Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown script
automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
