The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on distinct <b>pre-shared keys</b>
and <b>Fully Qualified Domain Names</b> and includes a <b>Postquantum Preshared Key (PPK)</b>
that's also mixed into the derived key material. The PPK_ID used by <b>dave</b> is
unknown to <b>moon</b> but since both peers don't enforce the use of a PPK they fall back
to regular authentication by use of the authentication data provided in the NO_PPK_AUTH
notify.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown-script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both
<b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
