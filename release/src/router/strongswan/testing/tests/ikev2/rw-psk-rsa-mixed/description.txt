The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> each set up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
<b>carol</b>'s authentication is based on a Pre-Shared Key (<b>PSK</b>) whereas <b>dave</b>'s
is based on an Public key signature (<b>Pubkey</b>). Gateway <b>moon</b> supports both
authentication modes and selects the correct roadwarrior connection definition based on the
gateway ID requested by the roadwarrior.

In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both
<b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
