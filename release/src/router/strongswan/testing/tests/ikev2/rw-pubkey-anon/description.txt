The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>raw public keys</b>
and IKEv2 key IDs. Gateway <b>moon</b> accepts all peers possessing a
public key a copy of which is stored in the <b>/etc/swanctl/pubkey</b> directory.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown script
automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
