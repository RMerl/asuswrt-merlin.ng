The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration payload.
<b>moon</b> explicitly assigns a specific virtual IP to each of the two clients.
<p/>
<b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the
tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping the client
<b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two pings will be the
virtual IPs <b>10.3.0.1</b> and <b>10.3.0.2</b>, respectively.
