A tunnel connecting the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b>,
respectively, is automatically established by means of the setting
<b>auto=start</b> in ipsec.conf. The connection is tested by client <b>alice</b>
behind gateway <b>moon</b> pinging the client <b>bob</b> located behind
gateway <b>sun</b>. The updown script automatically inserts iptables-based
firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
