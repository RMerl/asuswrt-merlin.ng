Using <b>[&lt;protocol&gt;/&lt;port&gt;]</b> selectors in the
<b>local_ts</b> and <b>remote_ts</b> child parameters, two IPsec tunnels
between the roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and the gateway <b>moon</b> are defined.
The first CHILD_SA is restricted to ICMP packets and the second
covers TCP-based SSH connections. The established tunnels are tested
by <b>carol</b> by first pinging <b>alice</b> behind <b>moon</b> and
then setting up an SSH session to the same client.
