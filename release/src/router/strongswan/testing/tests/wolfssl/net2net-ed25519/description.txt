A connection between the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> is set up.
The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b> containing <b>Ed25519</b> keys.
<b>moon</b> uses the wolfssl plugin based on the wolfCrypt library for all
cryptographical functions whereas <b>sun</b> uses the default strongSwan
cryptographical plugins.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, the updown script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, client <b>alice</b> behind gateway <b>moon</b>
pings client <b>bob</b> located behind gateway <b>sun</b>.
