tcpreplay is a tool for replaying network traffic from files saved with
tcpdump or other tools which write pcap(3) files.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend  all  packets  from  the
input file(s) at the speed at which they were recorded, or a specified 
data rate, up to as fast as the hardware is capable.
.sp
Optionally, the traffic can be split between two interfaces, written to
files, filtered and edited in various ways, providing the means to test
firewalls, NIDS and other network devices.
.sp
For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at:

.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-r\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-portmap\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Rewrite TCP/UDP ports.
This option may appear up to 9999 times.
.sp
Specify a list of comma delimited port mappings consisting of
colon delimited port number pairs.  Each colon delimited port pair
consists of the port to match followed by the port number to rewrite.
.sp
Examples:
.nf
    \--portmap=80:8000 \--portmap=8080:80    # 80->8000 and 8080->80
    \--portmap=8000,8080,88888:80           # 3 different ports become 80
    \--portmap=8000-8999:80                 # ports 8000 to 8999 become 80

Randomize src/dst IPv4/v6 addresses w/ given seed.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
fuzz-seed.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
Causes the source and destination IPv4/v6 addresses to be pseudo
randomized but still maintain client/server relationships.
Since the randomization is deterministic based on the seed,
you can reuse the same seed value to recreate the traffic.
.TP

This option may appear up to 2 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
srcipmap.
.sp
Takes a comma delimited series of colon delimited CIDR
netblock pairs.  Each netblock pair is evaluated in order against
the IP addresses.  If the IP address in the packet matches the
first netblock, it is rewritten using the second netblock as a
mask against the high order bits.
.sp
IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=192.168.0.0/16:10.77.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12:10.1.0.0/24

Remove Ethernet checksums (FCS) from end of frames.
.sp
Note, this option is pretty dangerous!  We do not actually check to see if a FCS
actually exists in the frame, we just blindly delete the last 4 bytes.  Hence,
you should only use this if you know know that your OS provides the FCS when
reading raw packets.

.sp
This fuzzing was designed as to test layer 7 protocols such as voip protocols.
It modifies randomly 1 out of X packets (where X = \fB--fuzz-factor\fP) in order
for stateful protocols to cover more of their code.  The random fuzzing actions
focus on data start and end because it often is the part of the data application
protocols base their decisions on.
.sp
Possible fuzzing actions list:
 * drop packet
 * reduce packet size
 * edit packet Bytes:
   * Not all Bytes have the same probability of appearance in real life.
     Replace with 0x00, 0xFF, or a random byte with equal likelihood.
   * Not all Bytes have the same significance in a packet.
     Replace the start, the end, or the middle of the packet with equal likelihood.
 * do nothing (7 out of 8 packets)

.sp
Sets the ratio of for \fB--fuzz-seed\fP option. By default this value is 8,
which means 1 in 8 packets are modified by fuzzing. Note that this ratio is
based on the random number generated by the supplied fuzz seed. Therefore by
default you cannot expect that exactly every eighth packet will be modified.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-skipl2broadcast\f[]
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast Layer 2 addresses.
.sp
By default, editing Layer 2 addresses will rewrite

you can create a cachefile which tcpreplay will use to split the traffic
across two network interfaces.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-2\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-dualfile\f[]
Replay two files at a time from a network tap.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
intf2.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
cachefile.
.sp
If you captured network traffic using a network tap, then you can end up with
two pcap files- one for each direction.  This option will replay these two
files at the same time, one on each interface and inter-mix them using the 
timestamps in each.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-i\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-intf1\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Client to server/RX/primary traffic output interface.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
Required network interface used to send either all traffic or traffic which is 
marked as 'primary' via tcpprep.  Primary traffic is usually client-to-server 
or inbound (RX) on khial virtual interfaces.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-I\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-intf2\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Server to client/TX/secondary traffic output interface.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
Optional network interface used to send traffic which is marked as 'secondary' 
via tcpprep.  Secondary traffic is usually server-to-client or outbound 
(TX) on khial virtual interfaces.  Generally, it only makes sense to use this
option with \--cachefile.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-listnics\f[]
List available network interfaces and exit.
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-l\f[] \f\*[I-Font]number\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-loop\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Loop through the capture file X times.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 0
.fi
.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 1
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-loopdelay\-ms\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Delay between loops in milliseconds.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
loop.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 0
.fi
.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-pktlen\f[]
Override the snaplen and use the actual packet len.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
By default, tcpreplay will send packets based on the size of the "snaplen"
stored in the pcap file which is usually the correct thing to do.  However,
occasionally, tools will store more bytes then told to.  By specifying this
option, tcpreplay will ignore the snaplen field and instead try to send
packets based on the original packet length.  Bad things may happen if
you specify this option.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-L\f[] \f\*[I-Font]number\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-limit\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Limit the number of packets to send.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 1
.fi
.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 \-1
.sp
By default, tcpreplay will send all the packets.  Alternatively, you can 
specify a maximum number of packets to send.  
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-duration\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Limit the number of seconds to send.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 1
.fi
.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 \-1
.sp
By default, tcpreplay will send all the packets.  Alternatively, you can
specify a maximum number of seconds to transmit.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-x\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-multiplier\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Modify replay speed to a given multiple.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
pps, mbps, oneatatime, topspeed.
.sp
Specify a value to modify the packet replay speed.
Examples:
.nf
        2.0 will replay traffic at twice the speed captured
        0.7 will replay traffic at 70% the speed captured
.fi
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-p\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-pps\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Replay packets at a given packets/sec.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
multiplier, mbps, oneatatime, topspeed.
.sp
Specify a value to regulate the packet replay to a specific packet-per-second rate.
Examples:
.nf
        200 will replay traffic at 200 packets per second
        0.25 will replay traffic at 15 packets per minute
.fi
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-M\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-mbps\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Replay packets at a given Mbps.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
multiplier, pps, oneatatime, topspeed.
.sp
Specify a floating point value for the Mbps rate that tcpreplay
should send packets at.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-t\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-topspeed\f[]
Replay packets as fast as possible.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
mbps, multiplier, pps, oneatatime.
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-o\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-oneatatime\f[]
Replay one packet at a time for each user input.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
mbps, pps, multiplier, topspeed.
.sp
Allows you to step through one or more packets at a time.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-pps\-multi\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Number of packets to send for each time interval.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
pps.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 1
.fi
.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 1
.sp
When trying to send packets at very high rates, the time between each packet
can be so short that it is impossible to accurately sleep for the required
period of time.  This option allows you to send multiple packets at a time,
thus allowing for longer sleep times which can be more accurately implemented.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-unique\-ip\f[]
Modify IP addresses each loop iteration to generate unique flows.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
loop.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
seed, fuzz-seed.
.sp
Ensure IPv4 and IPv6 packets will be unique for each \fB--loop\fP iteration. 
This is done in a way that will not alter packet CRC, and therefore will generally
not affect performance. This option will significantly increase the flows/sec over
generated over multiple loop iterations.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-unique\-ip\-loops\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Number of times to loop before assigning new unique ip.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
unique-ip.
.sp
Number of \fB--loop\fP iterations before a new unique IP is assigned. Default
is 1. Assumes both \fB--loop\fP and \fB--unique-ip\fP.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-netmap\f[]
Write packets directly to netmap enabled network adapter.
.sp
This feature will detect netmap capable network drivers on Linux and BSD
systems. If detected, the network driver is bypassed for the execution
duration, and network buffers will be written to directly. This will allow
you to achieve full line rates on commodity network adapters, similar to rates
achieved by commercial network traffic generators. Note that bypassing the network
driver will disrupt other applications connected through the test interface. See
INSTALL for more information.
.sp
This feature can also be enabled by specifying an interface as 'netmap:<intf>'
or 'vale:<intf>. For example 'netmap:eth0' specifies netmap over interface eth0.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-nm\-delay\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Netmap startup delay.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 10
.sp
Number of seconds to delay after netmap is loaded. Required to ensure interfaces
are fully up before netmap transmit. Requires netmap option. Default is 10 seconds.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no\-flow\-stats\f[]
Suppress printing and tracking flow count, rates and expirations.
.sp
Suppress the collection and printing of flow statistics. This option may
improve performance when not using \fB--preload-pcap\fP option, otherwise
its only function is to suppress printing. 
.sp
The flow feature will track and print statistics of the flows being sent. 
A flow is loosely defined as a unique combination of a 5-tuple, i.e. 
source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port and protocol.
.sp
If \fB--loop\fP is specified, the flows from one iteration to the next
will not be unique, unless the packets are altered. Use \fB--unique-ip\fP
or \fBtcpreplay-edit\fP to alter packets between iterations. 
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-flow\-expiry\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Number of inactive seconds before a flow is considered expired.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
no-flow-stats.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 0
.fi
.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
This option will track and report flow expirations based on the flow idle
times. The timestamps within the pcap file are used to determine the expiry,
not the actual timestamp of the packets are replayed. For example, a value of
30 suggests that if no traffic is seen on a flow for 30 seconds, any
subsequent traffic would be considered a new flow, and thereby will increment
the flows and flows per second (fps) statistics. 
.sp
This option can be used to optimize flow timeout settings for flow products.
Setting the timeout low may lead to flows being dropped when in fact the flow
is simply slow to respond. Configuring your flow timeouts too high may
increase resources required by your flow product.
.sp
Note that using this option while replaying at higher than original speeds
can lead to inflated flows and fps counts.
.sp
Default is 0 (no expiry) and a typical value is 30-120 seconds.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-P\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-pid\f[]
Print the PID of tcpreplay at startup.
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-stats\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Print statistics every X seconds, or every loop if '0'.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 0
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Note that timed delays are a "best effort" and long delays between
sending packets may cause equally long delays between printing statistics.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-V\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-version\f[]
Print version information.
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-h\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-less\-help\f[]
Display less usage information and exit.
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-H\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-help\f[]
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\&!\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-more-help\f[]
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-save-opts\f[] [=\f\*[I-Font]cfgfile\f[]]
Save the option state to \fIcfgfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
The command will exit after updating the config file.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-load-opts\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]cfgfile\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no-load-opts\f[]
Load options from \fIcfgfile\fP.
The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier config/rc/ini files.  \fI\-\-no-load-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.PP
.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
