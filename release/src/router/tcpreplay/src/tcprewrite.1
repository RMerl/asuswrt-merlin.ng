.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Tcprewrite is a tool to rewrite packets stored in \fIpcap(3)\fP file format,
such as created by tools such as \fItcpdump(1)\fP and \fIwireshark(1)\fP.
Once a pcap file has had it's packets rewritten, they can be replayed back
out on the network using \fItcpreplay(1)\fP.
.sp
tcprewrite currently supports reading the following DLT types:
.sp 1
\fBDLT_C_HDLC\fP aka Cisco HDLC
.sp 1
\fBDLT_EN10MB\fP aka Ethernet
.sp 1
\fBDLT_LINUX_SLL\fP aka Linux Cooked Socket
.sp 1
\fBDLT_RAW\fP aka RAW IP
.sp 1
\fBDLT_NULL\fP aka BSD Loopback
.sp 1
\fBDLT_LOOP\fP aka OpenBSD Loopback
.sp 1
\fBDLT_IEEE802_11\fP aka 802.11a/b/g
.sp 1
\fBDLT_IEEE802_11_RADIO\fP aka 802.11a/b/g with Radiotap headers
.sp 1
\fBDLT_JUNIPER_ETHER\fP aka Juniper Encapsulated Ethernet
.sp 1
\fBDLT_PPP_SERIAL\fP aka PPP over Serial
.sp
Please see the \--dlt option for supported DLT types for writing.
.sp
The packet editing features of tcprewrite which distinguish between "client"
and "server" traffic requires a tcpprep(1) cache file.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS ""
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-r\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-portmap\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Rewrite TCP/UDP ports.
This option may appear up to 9999 times.
.sp
Specify a list of comma delimited port mappings consisting of
colon delimited port number pairs.  Each colon delimited port pair
consists of the port to match followed by the port number to rewrite.
.sp
Examples:
.nf
    \--portmap=80:8000 \--portmap=8080:80    # 80->8000 and 8080->80
    \--portmap=8000,8080,88888:80           # 3 different ports become 80
    \--portmap=8000-8999:80                 # ports 8000 to 8999 become 80
.fi
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-s\f[] \f\*[I-Font]number\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-seed\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Randomize src/dst IPv4/v6 addresses w/ given seed.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
fuzz-seed.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
Causes the source and destination IPv4/v6 addresses to be pseudo
randomized but still maintain client/server relationships.
Since the randomization is deterministic based on the seed,
you can reuse the same seed value to recreate the traffic.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-N\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-pnat\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Rewrite IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 2 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
srcipmap.
.sp
Takes a comma delimited series of colon delimited CIDR
netblock pairs.  Each netblock pair is evaluated in order against
the IP addresses.  If the IP address in the packet matches the
first netblock, it is rewritten using the second netblock as a
mask against the high order bits.
.sp
IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=192.168.0.0/16:10.77.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12:10.1.0.0/24
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=[2001:db8::/32]:[dead::/16],[2001:db8::/32]:[::ffff:0:0/96]

This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:

addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-D\f[] \f\*[I-Font]string\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-dstipmap\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]
Rewrite destination IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 1 times.

Rewrite IP addresses to be between two endpoints.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
cachefile.
.sp
Takes a pair of colon delimited IPv4/v6 addresses which will be used to rewrite
all traffic to appear to be between the two IP addresses.
.sp

This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
is constrained to being:

.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
Change all TCP sequence numbers, and related sequence-acknowledgement numbers.
They will be shifted by a random amount based on the provided seed.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-b\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-skipbroadcast\f[]
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 addresses.
.sp
By default \--seed, \--pnat and \--endpoints will rewrite
broadcast and multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses.	Setting this flag
will keep broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses from being rewritten.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-C\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-fixcsum\f[]

no larger then the MTU.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-E\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-efcs\f[]
Remove Ethernet checksums (FCS) from end of frames.
.sp
Note, this option is pretty dangerous!  We do not actually check to see if a FCS
actually exists in the frame, we just blindly delete the last 4 bytes.  Hence,
you should only use this if you know know that your OS provides the FCS when
reading raw packets.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-ttl\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]string\f[]

to reflect the stored packet length.
.sp 1
\fBpad\fP
Truncated packets will be padded out so that the packet length matches the
IPv4 total length
.sp 1
\fBtrunc\fP

.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-fuzz\-seed\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]

.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
This fuzzing was designed as to test layer 7 protocols such as voip protocols.
It modifies randomly 1 out of X packets (where X = \fB--fuzz-factor\fP) in order
for stateful protocols to cover more of their code.  The random fuzzing actions
focus on data start and end because it often is the part of the data application
protocols base their decisions on.
.sp
Possible fuzzing actions list:
 * drop packet
 * reduce packet size
 * edit packet Bytes:
   * Not all Bytes have the same probability of appearance in real life.
     Replace with 0x00, 0xFF, or a random byte with equal likelihood.
   * Not all Bytes have the same significance in a packet.
     Replace the start, the end, or the middle of the packet with equal likelihood.
 * do nothing (7 out of 8 packets)
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-fuzz\-factor\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
Set the Fuzz 1 in X packet ratio (default 1 in 8 packets).

.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]number\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 8
.sp
Sets the ratio of for \fB--fuzz-seed\fP option. By default this value is 8,
which means 1 in 8 packets are modified by fuzzing. Note that this ratio is
based on the random number generated by the supplied fuzz seed. Therefore by
default you cannot expect that exactly every eighth packet will be modified.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-skipl2broadcast\f[]
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast Layer 2 addresses.
.sp
By default, editing Layer 2 addresses will rewrite

cachefile.
.sp
Apply the fragroute engine to packets going c2s, s2c or both when
using a cache file.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-skip\-soft\-errors\f[]
Skip writing packets with soft errors.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
In some cases, packets can not be decoded or the requested editing
is not possible.  Normally these packets are written to the output
file unedited so that tcpprep cache files can still be used, but if
you wish, these packets can be suppressed.
.sp
One example of this is 802.11 management frames which contain no data.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-V\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-version\f[]
Print version information.
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-h\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-less\-help\f[]
Display less usage information and exit.
.sp
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-H\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-help\f[]
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\&!\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-more-help\f[]
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-save-opts\f[] [=\f\*[I-Font]cfgfile\f[]]
Save the option state to \fIcfgfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
The command will exit after updating the config file.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-load-opts\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]cfgfile\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no-load-opts\f[]
Load options from \fIcfgfile\fP.
The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier config/rc/ini files.  \fI\-\-no-load-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.PP
.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
The \fIhomerc\fP file is "\fI$$/\fP", unless that is a directory.
In that case, the file "\fI.tcprewriterc\fP"
is searched for within that directory.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.NOP 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
.TP
.NOP 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.TP
.NOP 66 " (EX_NOINPUT)"
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.
.TP
.NOP 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
