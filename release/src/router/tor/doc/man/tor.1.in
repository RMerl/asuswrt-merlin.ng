.SH "NAME"
tor \- The second\-generation onion router
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtor\fR [\fIOPTION\fR \fIvalue\fR]\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Tor is a connection\-oriented anonymizing communication service\&. Users choose a source\-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network\&. Each node in a virtual circuit knows its predecessor and successor nodes, but no other nodes\&. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node\&.
.sp
Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers or relays ("onion routers")\&. Users bounce their TCP streams, including web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc\&., around the network, so that recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream\&.

.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"
.sp
Tor has a powerful command\-line interface\&. This section lists optional arguments you can specify at the command line using the \fBtor\fR command\&.
.sp
Configuration options can be specified on the command line in the format \fB\-\-\fR\fIOptionName\fR \fIOptionValue\fR, on the command line in the format \fIOptionName\fR \fIOptionValue\fR, or in a configuration file\&. For instance, you can tell Tor to start listening for SOCKS connections on port 9999 by passing either \fB\-\-SocksPort 9999\fR or \fBSocksPort 9999\fR on the command line, or by specifying \fBSocksPort 9999\fR in the configuration file\&. On the command line, quote option values that contain spaces\&. For instance, if you want Tor to log all debugging messages to \fBdebug\&.log\fR, you must specify \fB\-\-Log "debug file debug\&.log"\fR\&.

The

Running
\fBtor \-\-key\-expiration sign\fR
will attempt to find your signing key certificate and will output, both in the logs as well as to stdout\&. The optional
\fB\-\-format\fR
argument lets you specify the time format\&. Currently,
\fBiso8601\fR
and
\fBtimestamp\fR
are supported\&. If
\fB\-\-format\fR
is not specified, the signing key certificate\(cqs expiration time will be in ISO\-8601 format\&. For example, the output sent to stdout will be of the form: "signing\-cert\-expiry: 2017\-07\-25 08:30:15 UTC"\&. If
\fB\-\-format\fR
\fBtimestamp\fR
is specified, the signing key certificate\(cqs expiration time will be in Unix timestamp format\&. For example, the output sent to stdout will be of the form: "signing\-cert\-expiry: 1500971415"\&.

\fB\-\-dbg\-\fR\&...
.RS 4
Tor may support other options beginning with the string "dbg"\&. These are intended for use by developers to debug and test Tor\&. They are not supported or guaranteed to be stable, and you should probably not use them\&.
.RE
.SH "THE CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.sp
All configuration options in a configuration are written on a single line by default\&. They take the form of an option name and a value, or an option name and a quoted value (option value or option "value")\&. Anything after a # character is treated as a comment\&. Options are case\-insensitive\&. C\-style escaped characters are allowed inside quoted values\&. To split one configuration entry into multiple lines, use a single backslash character (\e) before the end of the line\&. Comments can be used in such multiline entries, but they must start at the beginning of a line\&.
.sp
Configuration options can be imported from files or folders using the %include option with the value being a path\&. This path can have wildcards\&. Wildcards are expanded first, then sorted using lexical order\&. Then, for each matching file or folder, the following rules are followed: if the path is a file, the options from the file will be parsed as if they were written where the %include option is\&. If the path is a folder, all files on that folder will be parsed following lexical order\&. Files starting with a dot are ignored\&. Files in subfolders are ignored\&. The %include option can be used recursively\&. New configuration files or directories cannot be added to already running Tor instance if \fBSandbox\fR is enabled\&.
.sp
The supported wildcards are * meaning any number of characters including none and ? meaning exactly one character\&. These characters can be escaped by preceding them with a backslash, except on Windows\&. Files starting with a dot are not matched when expanding wildcards unless the starting dot is explicitly in the pattern, except on Windows\&.
.sp
By default, an option on the command line overrides an option found in the configuration file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in the defaults file\&.
.sp
This rule is simple for options that take a single value, but it can become complicated for options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you specify four SocksPorts in your configuration file, and one more SocksPort on the command line, the option on the command line will replace \fIall\fR of the SocksPorts in the configuration file\&. If this isn\(cqt what you want, prefix the option name with a plus sign (+), and it will be appended to the previous set of options instead\&. For example, setting SocksPort 9100 will use only port 9100, but setting +SocksPort 9100 will use ports 9100 and 9050 (because this is the default)\&.
.sp
Alternatively, you might want to remove every instance of an option in the configuration file, and not replace it at all: you might want to say on the command line that you want no SocksPorts at all\&. To do that, prefix the option name with a forward slash (/)\&. You can use the plus sign (+) and the forward slash (/) in the configuration file and on the command line\&.

These options behave as DirAuthority, but they replace fewer of the default directory authorities\&.

.RS 4
A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value\&. If you want to run a relay in the public network, this needs to be
\fIat the very least\fR
75 KBytes for a relay (that is, 600 kbits) or 50 KBytes for a bridge (400 kbits) \(em but of course, more is better; we recommend at least 250 KBytes (2 mbits) if possible\&. (Default: 1 GByte)


Note that this option, and other bandwidth\-limiting options, apply to TCP data only: They do not count TCP headers or DNS traffic\&.


Tor uses powers of two, not powers of ten, so 1 GByte is 1024*1024*1024 bytes as opposed to 1 billion bytes\&.


With this option, and in other options that take arguments in bytes, KBytes, and so on, other formats are also supported\&. Notably, "KBytes" can also be written as "kilobytes" or "kb"; "MBytes" can be written as "megabytes" or "MB"; "kbits" can be written as "kilobits"; and so forth\&. Case doesn\(cqt matter\&. Tor also accepts "byte" and "bit" in the singular\&. The prefixes "tera" and "T" are also recognized\&. If no units are given, we default to bytes\&. To avoid confusion, we recommend writing "bytes" or "bits" explicitly, since it\(cqs easy to forget that "B" means bytes, not bits\&.

It is delivered first to the circuit that has the lowest weighted cell count, where cells are weighted exponentially according to this value (in seconds)\&. If the value is \-1, it is taken from the consensus if possible else it will fallback to the default value of 30\&. Minimum: 1, Maximum: 2147483647\&. This can be defined as a float value\&.

.RS 4
In its first form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client forwards its traffic to a SOCKS\-speaking proxy on "IP:PORT"\&. (IPv4 addresses should written as\-is; IPv6 addresses should be wrapped in square brackets\&.) It\(cqs the duty of that proxy to properly forward the traffic to the bridge\&.


In its second form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client launches the pluggable transport proxy executable in
\fIpath\-to\-binary\fR
using
\fIoptions\fR
as its command\-line options, and forwards its traffic to it\&. It\(cqs the duty of that proxy to properly forward the traffic to the bridge\&. (Default: none)
.RE
.PP
\fBConnLimit\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS 4
The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available to the Tor process before it will start\&. Tor will ask the OS for as many file descriptors as the OS will allow (you can find this by "ulimit \-H \-n")\&. If this number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to start\&.


Tor relays need thousands of sockets, to connect to every other relay\&. If you are running a private bridge, you can reduce the number of sockets that Tor uses\&. For example, to limit Tor to 500 sockets, run "ulimit \-n 500" in a shell\&. Then start tor in the same shell, with
\fBConnLimit 500\fR\&. You may also need to set
\fBDisableOOSCheck 0\fR\&.


Unless you have severely limited sockets, you probably don\(cqt need to adjust
\fBConnLimit\fR
itself\&. It has no effect on Windows, since that platform lacks getrlimit()\&. (Default: 1000)
.RE
.PP
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the buffers for all sockets to the size specified in
\fBConstrainedSockSize\fR\&. This is useful for virtual servers and other environments where system level TCP buffers may be limited\&. If you\(cqre on a virtual server, and you encounter the "Error creating network socket: No buffer space available" message, you are likely experiencing this problem\&.


The preferred solution is to have the admin increase the buffer pool for the host itself via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility; this configuration option is a second\-resort\&.


The DirPort option should also not be used if TCP buffers are scarce\&. The cached directory requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates the problem\&.


You should
\fBnot\fR
enable this feature unless you encounter the "no buffer space available" issue\&. Reducing the TCP buffers affects window size for the TCP stream and will reduce throughput in proportion to round trip time on long paths\&. (Default: 0)

\fBCookieAuthentication\fR, setting this option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local host to control it\&. (Setting both authentication methods means either method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor\&.) This option is required for many Tor controllers; most use the value of 9051\&. If a unix domain socket is used, you may quote the path using standard C escape sequences\&. You can specify this directive multiple times, to bind to multiple address/port pairs\&.

.RS 4
Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the provided address and port, with the specified key fingerprint\&. This option can be repeated many times, for multiple authoritative directory servers\&. Flags are separated by spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this directory is\&. By default, an authority is not authoritative for any directory style or version unless an appropriate flag is given\&.


Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative directory if the "bridge" flag is set\&. If a flag "orport=\fBorport\fR" is given, Tor will use the given port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver\&. If a flag "weight=\fBnum\fR" is given, then the directory server is chosen randomly with probability proportional to that weight (default 1\&.0)\&. If a flag "v3ident=\fBfp\fR" is given, the dirserver is a v3 directory authority whose v3 long\-term signing key has the fingerprint
\fBfp\fR\&. Lastly, if an "ipv6=\fB[\fR\fIipv6address\fR\fB]\fR:\fIorport\fR" flag is present, then the directory authority is listening for IPv6 connections on the indicated IPv6 address and OR Port\&.


Tor will contact the authority at
\fIipv4address\fR

If no

Limits the max number of bytes sent and received within a set time period using a given calculation rule (see
AccountingStart

For example, with AccountingMax set to 1 TByte, a server could send 900 GBytes and receive 800 GBytes and continue running\&. It will only hibernate once one of the two reaches 1 TByte\&. This can be changed to use the sum of the both bytes received and sent by setting the AccountingRule option to "sum" (total bandwidth in/out)\&. When the number of bytes remaining gets low, Tor will stop accepting new connections and circuits\&. When the number of bytes is exhausted, Tor will hibernate until some time in the next accounting period\&. To prevent all servers from waking at the same time, Tor will also wait until a random point in each period before waking up\&. If you have bandwidth cost issues, enabling hibernation is preferable to setting a low bandwidth, since it provides users with a collection of fast servers that are up some of the time, which is more useful than a set of slow servers that are always "available"\&.


Note that (as also described in the Bandwidth section) Tor uses powers of two, not powers of ten: 1 GByte is 1024*1024*1024, not one billion\&. Be careful: some internet service providers might count GBytes differently\&.

\fBExitPolicy\fR \fIpolicy\fR,\fIpolicy\fR,\fI\&...\fR
.RS 4
Set an exit policy for this server\&. Each policy is of the form "\fBaccept[6]\fR|\fBreject[6]\fR
\fIADDR\fR[/\fIMASK\fR][:\fIPORT\fR]"\&. If /\fIMASK\fR
is omitted then this policy just applies to the host given\&. Instead of giving a host or network you can also use "*" to denote the universe (0\&.0\&.0\&.0/0 and ::/0), or *4 to denote all IPv4 addresses, and *6 to denote all IPv6 addresses\&.
\fIPORT\fR
can be a single port number, an interval of ports "\fIFROM_PORT\fR\-\fITO_PORT\fR", or "*"\&. If
\fIPORT\fR
is omitted, that means "*"\&.


For example, "accept 18\&.7\&.22\&.69:*,reject 18\&.0\&.0\&.0/8:*,accept *:*" would reject any IPv4 traffic destined for MIT except for web\&.mit\&.edu, and accept any other IPv4 or IPv6 traffic\&.


Tor also allows IPv6 exit policy entries\&. For instance, "reject6 [FC00::]/7:*" rejects all destinations that share 7 most significant bit prefix with address FC00::\&. Respectively, "accept6 [C000::]/3:*" accepts all destinations that share 3 most significant bit prefix with address C000::\&.


accept6 and reject6 only produce IPv6 exit policy entries\&. Using an IPv4 address with accept6 or reject6 is ignored and generates a warning\&. accept/reject allows either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses\&. Use *4 as an IPv4 wildcard address, and *6 as an IPv6 wildcard address\&. accept/reject * expands to matching IPv4 and IPv6 wildcard address rules\&.


To specify all IPv4 and IPv6 internal and link\-local networks (including 0\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 169\&.254\&.0\&.0/16, 127\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16, 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 172\&.16\&.0\&.0/12, [::]/8, [FC00::]/7, [FE80::]/10, [FEC0::]/10, [FF00::]/8, and [::]/127), you can use the "private" alias instead of an address\&. ("private" always produces rules for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, even when used with accept6/reject6\&.)


Private addresses are rejected by default (at the beginning of your exit policy), along with any configured primary public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&. These private addresses are rejected unless you set the ExitPolicyRejectPrivate config option to 0\&. For example, once you\(cqve done that, you could allow HTTP to 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 and block all other connections to internal networks with "accept 127\&.0\&.0\&.1:80,reject private:*", though that may also allow connections to your own computer that are addressed to its public (external) IP address\&. See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more details about internal and reserved IP address space\&. See
ExitPolicyRejectLocalInterfaces
if you want to block every address on the relay, even those that aren\(cqt advertised in the descriptor\&.


This directive can be specified multiple times so you don\(cqt have to put it all on one line\&.


Policies are considered first to last, and the first match wins\&. If you want to allow the same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules using accept/reject *\&. If you want to allow different ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your IPv6 rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules using accept/reject *4\&. If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end your exit policy with either a reject *:* or an accept *:*\&. Otherwise, you\(cqre _augmenting_ (prepending to) the default exit policy\&.


If you want to use a reduced exit policy rather than the default exit policy, set "ReducedExitPolicy 1"\&. If you want to

the default exit policy with your custom exit policy, end your exit policy with either a reject

The onion service will use the given protocol to expose the global circuit identifier of each inbound client circuit\&. The only protocol supported right now \*(Aqhaproxy\*(Aq\&. This option is only for v3 services\&. (Default: none)


The haproxy option works in the following way: when the feature is enabled, the Tor process will write a header line when a client is connecting to the onion service\&. The header will look like this:


"PROXY TCP6 fc00:dead:beef:4dad::ffff:ffff ::1 65535 42\er\en"


We encode the "global circuit identifier" as the last 32\-bits of the first IPv6 address\&. All other values in the header can safely be ignored\&. You can compute the global circuit identifier using the following formula given the IPv6 address "fc00:dead:beef:4dad::AABB:CCDD":


global_circuit_id = (0xAA << 24) + (0xBB << 16) + (0xCC << 8) + 0xDD;


In the case above, where the last 32\-bits are 0xffffffff, the global circuit identifier would be 4294967295\&. You can use this value together with Tor\(cqs control port to terminate particular circuits using their global circuit identifiers\&. For more information about this see control\-spec\&.txt\&.

Tor catches the following signals:
.PP
\fBSIGTERM\fR
.RS 4
Tor will catch this, clean up and sync to disk if necessary, and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSIGINT\fR
.RS 4
Tor clients behave as with SIGTERM; but Tor servers will do a controlled slow shutdown, closing listeners and waiting 30 seconds before exiting\&. (The delay can be configured with the ShutdownWaitLength config option\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBSIGHUP\fR
.RS 4
The signal instructs Tor to reload its configuration (including closing and reopening logs), and kill and restart its helper processes if applicable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSIGUSR1\fR
.RS 4
Log statistics about current connections, past connections, and throughput\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSIGUSR2\fR
.RS 4
Switch all logs to loglevel debug\&. You can go back to the old loglevels by sending a SIGHUP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSIGCHLD\fR
.RS 4
Tor receives this signal when one of its helper processes has exited, so it can clean up\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSIGPIPE\fR
.RS 4
Tor catches this signal and ignores it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSIGXFSZ\fR
.RS 4
If this signal exists on your platform, Tor catches and ignores it\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fB@CONFDIR@/torrc\fR
.RS 4
Default location of the configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB$HOME/\&.torrc\fR
.RS 4
Fallback location for torrc, if @CONFDIR@/torrc is not found\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/tor/\fR
.RS 4
The tor process stores keys and other data here\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICacheDirectory\fR/\fBcached\-certs\fR
.RS 4
Contains downloaded directory key certificates that are used to verify authenticity of documents generated by the Tor directory authorities\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICacheDirectory\fR/\fBcached\-consensus\fR and/or \fBcached\-microdesc\-consensus\fR
.RS 4
The most recent consensus network status document we\(cqve downloaded\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICacheDirectory\fR/\fBcached\-descriptors\fR and \fBcached\-descriptors\&.new\fR
.RS 4
These files contain the downloaded router statuses\&. Some routers may appear more than once; if so, the most recently published descriptor is used\&. Lines beginning with
\fB@\fR\-signs are annotations that contain more information about a given router\&. The
\fB\&.new\fR
file is an append\-only journal; when it gets too large, all entries are merged into a new cached\-descriptors file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICacheDirectory\fR/\fBcached\-extrainfo\fR and \fBcached\-extrainfo\&.new\fR
.RS 4
Similar to
\fBcached\-descriptors\fR, but holds optionally\-downloaded "extra\-info" documents\&. Relays use these documents to send inessential information about statistics, bandwidth history, and network health to the authorities\&. They aren\(cqt fetched by default\&. See
DownloadExtraInfo
for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICacheDirectory\fR/\fBcached\-microdescs\fR and \fBcached\-microdescs\&.new\fR
.RS 4
These files hold downloaded microdescriptors\&. Lines beginning with
\fB@\fR\-signs are annotations that contain more information about a given router\&. The
\fB\&.new\fR
file is an append\-only journal; when it gets too large, all entries are merged into a new cached\-microdescs file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDataDirectory\fR/\fBstate\fR

.RE
.RE
.PP
\fIDataDirectory\fR/\fBsr\-state\fR
.RS 4
\fIAuthority only\fR\&. This file is used to record information about the current status of the shared\-random\-value voting state\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICacheDirectory\fR/\fBdiff\-cache\fR
.RS 4
\fIDirectory cache only\fR\&. Holds older consensuses and diffs from oldest to the most recent consensus of each type compressed in various ways\&. Each file contains a set of key\-value arguments describing its contents, followed by a single NUL byte, followed by the main file contents\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDataDirectory\fR/\fBbw_accounting\fR
.RS 4
This file is obsolete and the data is now stored in the
\fBstate\fR
file instead\&. Used to track bandwidth accounting values (when the current period starts and ends; how much has been read and written so far this period)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDataDirectory\fR/\fBcontrol_auth_cookie\fR
.RS 4
This file can be used only when cookie authentication is enabled\&. Used for cookie authentication with the controller\&. Location can be overridden by the
CookieAuthFile
configuration option\&. Regenerated on startup\&. See control\-spec\&.txt in
torspec
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDataDirectory\fR/\fBlock\fR
.RS 4
This file is used to prevent two Tor instances from using the same data directory\&. If access to this file is locked, data directory is already in use by Tor\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDataDirectory\fR/\fBkey\-pinning\-journal\fR
.RS 4
Used by authorities\&. A line\-based file that records mappings between RSA1024 and Ed25519 identity keys\&. Authorities enforce these mappings, so that once a relay has picked an Ed25519 key, stealing or factoring the RSA1024 key will no longer let an attacker impersonate the relay\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBauthority_identity_key\fR
.RS 4
A v3 directory authority\(cqs master identity key, used to authenticate its signing key\&. Tor doesn\(cqt use this while it\(cqs running\&. The tor\-gencert program uses this\&. If you\(cqre running an authority, you should keep this key offline, and not put it in this file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBauthority_certificate\fR
.RS 4
Only directory authorities use this file\&. A v3 directory authority\(cqs certificate which authenticates the authority\(cqs current vote\- and consensus\-signing key using its master identity key\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBauthority_signing_key\fR
.RS 4
Only directory authorities use this file\&. A v3 directory authority\(cqs signing key that is used to sign votes and consensuses\&. Corresponds to the
\fBauthority_certificate\fR
cert\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBlegacy_certificate\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBsecret_id_key\fR
.RS 4
A relay\(cqs RSA1024 permanent identity key, including private and public components\&. Used to sign router descriptors, and to sign other keys\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBed25519_master_id_public_key\fR
.RS 4
The public part of a relay\(cqs Ed25519 permanent identity key\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBed25519_master_id_secret_key\fR
.RS 4
The private part of a relay\(cqs Ed25519 permanent identity key\&. This key is used to sign the medium\-term ed25519 signing key\&. This file can be kept offline or encrypted\&. If so, Tor will not be able to generate new signing keys automatically; you\(cqll need to use
tor \-\-keygen
to do so\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBed25519_signing_secret_key\fR
.RS 4
The private and public components of a relay\(cqs medium\-term Ed25519 signing key\&. This key is authenticated by the Ed25519 master key, which in turn authenticates other keys (and router descriptors)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBed25519_signing_cert\fR
.RS 4
The certificate which authenticates "ed25519_signing_secret_key" as having been signed by the Ed25519 master key\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBsecret_onion_key\fR and \fBsecret_onion_key\&.old\fR
.RS 4
A relay\(cqs RSA1024 short\-term onion key\&. Used to decrypt old\-style ("TAP") circuit extension requests\&. The
\fB\&.old\fR
file holds the previously generated key, which the relay uses to handle any requests that were made by clients that didn\(cqt have the new one\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKeyDirectory\fR/\fBsecret_onion_key_ntor\fR and \fBsecret_onion_key_ntor\&.old\fR
.RS 4
A relay\(cqs Curve25519 short\-term onion key\&. Used to handle modern ("ntor") circuit extension requests\&. The
\fB\&.old\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIDataDirectory\fR/\fBapproved\-routers\fR
.RS 4
Only used by authoritative directory servers\&. Each line lists a status and an identity, separated by whitespace\&. Identities can be hex\-encoded RSA fingerprints, or base\-64 encoded ed25519 public keys\&. See the
\fBfingerprint\fR
file in a tor relay\(cqs
\fIDataDirectory\fR
for an example fingerprint line\&. If the status is
\fB!reject\fR, then descriptors from the given identity are rejected by this server\&. If it is
\fB!invalid\fR
then descriptors are accepted, but marked in the vote as not valid\&. If it is
\fB!badexit\fR, then the authority will vote for it to receive a BadExit flag, indicating that it shouldn\(cqt be used for traffic leaving the Tor network\&. (Neither rejected nor invalid relays are included in the consensus\&.)
.RE
.PP
