.SH "NAME"
tor \- The second\-generation onion router
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtor\fR [\fIOPTION\fR \fIvalue\fR]\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Tor is a connection\-oriented anonymizing communication service\&. Users choose a source\-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others\&. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node\&.
.sp
Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers or relays ("onion routers")\&. Users bounce their TCP streams \(em web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc\&. \(em around the network, and recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream\&.
.sp
By default, \fBtor\fR will act as a client only\&. To help the network by providing bandwidth as a relay, change the \fBORPort\fR configuration option \(em see below\&. Please also consult the documentation on the Tor Project\(cqs website\&.
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display a short help message and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Specify a new configuration file to contain further Tor configuration options OR pass
\fB\-\fR
to make Tor read its configuration from standard input\&. (Default: @CONFDIR@/torrc, or $HOME/\&.torrc if that file is not found)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-allow\-missing\-torrc\fR
.RS 4
Do not require that configuration file specified by
\fB\-f\fR
exist if default torrc can be accessed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-defaults\-torrc\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Specify a file in which to find default values for Tor options\&. The contents of this file are overridden by those in the regular configuration file, and by those on the command line\&. (Default: @CONFDIR@/torrc\-defaults\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\-torrc\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Tor should treat a missing torrc file as though it were empty\&. Ordinarily, Tor does this for missing default torrc files, but not for those specified on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-hash\-password\fR \fIPASSWORD\fR
.RS 4
Generates a hashed password for control port access\&.
.RE
.PP

\fB\-\-verify\-config\fR
.RS 4
Verify the configuration file is valid\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-service install\fR [\fB\-\-options\fR \fIcommand\-line options\fR]
.RS 4
Install an instance of Tor as a Windows service, with the provided command\-line options\&. Current instructions can be found at
https://www\&.torproject\&.org/docs/faq#NTService
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-service\fR \fBremove\fR|\fBstart\fR|\fBstop\fR
.RS 4
Remove, start, or stop a configured Tor Windows service\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nt\-service\fR
.RS 4
Used internally to implement a Windows service\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-list\-torrc\-options\fR
.RS 4
List all valid options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-list\-deprecated\-options\fR
.RS 4
List all valid options that are scheduled to become obsolete in a future version\&. (This is a warning, not a promise\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-list\-modules\fR
.RS 4
For each optional module, list whether or not it has been compiled into Tor\&. (Any module not listed is not optional in this version of Tor\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Display Tor version and exit\&. The output is a single line of the format "Tor version [version number]\&." (The version number format is as specified in version\-spec\&.txt\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR|\fB\-\-hush\fR
.RS 4
Override the default console log\&. By default, Tor starts out logging messages at level "notice" and higher to the console\&. It stops doing so after it parses its configuration, if the configuration tells it to log anywhere else\&. You can override this behavior with the
\fB\-\-hush\fR
option, which tells Tor to only send warnings and errors to the console, or with the
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
option, which tells Tor not to log to the console at all\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keygen\fR [\fB\-\-newpass\fR]
.RS 4
Running "tor \-\-keygen" creates a new ed25519 master identity key for a relay, or only a fresh temporary signing key and certificate, if you already have a master key\&. Optionally you can encrypt the master identity key with a passphrase: Tor will ask you for one\&. If you don\(cqt want to encrypt the master key, just don\(cqt enter any passphrase when asked\&.


The
\fB\-\-newpass\fR
option should be used with \-\-keygen only when you need to add, change, or remove a passphrase on an existing ed25519 master identity key\&. You will be prompted for the old passphase (if any), and the new passphrase (if any)\&.


When generating a master key, you will probably want to use
\fB\-\-DataDirectory\fR
to control where the keys and certificates will be stored, and
\fB\-\-SigningKeyLifetime\fR
to control their lifetimes\&. Their behavior is as documented in the server options section below\&. (You must have write access to the specified DataDirectory\&.)


To use the generated files, you must copy them to the DataDirectory/keys directory of your Tor daemon, and make sure that they are owned by the user actually running the Tor daemon on your system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-passphrase\-fd\fR \fIFILEDES\fR
.RS 4
Filedescriptor to read the passphrase from\&. Note that unlike with the tor\-gencert program, the entire file contents are read and used as the passphrase, including any trailing newlines\&. Default: read from the terminal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-key\-expiration\fR [\fBpurpose\fR]
.RS 4
The
\fBpurpose\fR
specifies which type of key certificate to determine the expiration of\&. The only currently recognised
\fBpurpose\fR
is "sign"\&.


Running "tor \-\-key\-expiration sign" will attempt to find your signing key certificate and will output, both in the logs as well as to stdout, the signing key certificate\(cqs expiration time in ISO\-8601 format\&. For example, the output sent to stdout will be of the form: "signing\-cert\-expiry: 2017\-07\-25 08:30:15 UTC"
.RE
.sp
Other options can be specified on the command\-line in the format "\-\-option value", in the format "option value", or in a configuration file\&. For instance, you can tell Tor to start listening for SOCKS connections on port 9999 by passing \-\-SocksPort 9999 or SocksPort 9999 to it on the command line, or by putting "SocksPort 9999" in the configuration file\&. You will need to quote options with spaces in them: if you want Tor to log all debugging messages to debug\&.log, you will probably need to say \fB\-\-Log\fR "debug file debug\&.log"\&.
.sp
Options on the command line override those in configuration files\&. See the next section for more information\&.
.SH "THE CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.sp
All configuration options in a configuration are written on a single line by default\&. They take the form of an option name and a value, or an option name and a quoted value (option value or option "value")\&. Anything after a # character is treated as a comment\&. Options are case\-insensitive\&. C\-style escaped characters are allowed inside quoted values\&. To split one configuration entry into multiple lines, use a single backslash character (\e) before the end of the line\&. Comments can be used in such multiline entries, but they must start at the beginning of a line\&.
.sp
Configuration options can be imported from files or folders using the %include option with the value being a path\&. If the path is a file, the options from the file will be parsed as if they were written where the %include option is\&. If the path is a folder, all files on that folder will be parsed following lexical order\&. Files starting with a dot are ignored\&. Files on subfolders are ignored\&. The %include option can be used recursively\&.
.sp
By default, an option on the command line overrides an option found in the configuration file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in the defaults file\&.
.sp
This rule is simple for options that take a single value, but it can become complicated for options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you specify four SocksPorts in your configuration file, and one more SocksPort on the command line, the option on the command line will replace \fIall\fR of the SocksPorts in the configuration file\&. If this isn\(cqt what you want, prefix the option name with a plus sign (+), and it will be appended to the previous set of options instead\&. For example, setting SocksPort 9100 will use only port 9100, but setting +SocksPort 9100 will use ports 9100 and 9050 (because this is the default)\&.
.sp
Alternatively, you might want to remove every instance of an option in the configuration file, and not replace it at all: you might want to say on the command line that you want no SocksPorts at all\&. To do that, prefix the option name with a forward slash (/)\&. You can use the plus sign (+) and the forward slash (/) in the configuration file and on the command line\&.

.RS 4
A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value\&. If you want to run a relay in the public network, this needs to be
\fIat the very least\fR
75 KBytes for a relay (that is, 600 kbits) or 50 KBytes for a bridge (400 kbits) \(em but of course, more is better; we recommend at least 250 KBytes (2 mbits) if possible\&. (Default: 1 GByte)


Note that this option, and other bandwidth\-limiting options, apply to TCP data only: They do not count TCP headers or DNS traffic\&.


Tor uses powers of two, not powers of ten, so 1 GByte is 1024*1024*1024 bytes as opposed to 1 billion bytes\&.


With this option, and in other options that take arguments in bytes, KBytes, and so on, other formats are also supported\&. Notably, "KBytes" can also be written as "kilobytes" or "kb"; "MBytes" can be written as "megabytes" or "MB"; "kbits" can be written as "kilobits"; and so forth\&. Case doesn\(cqt matter\&. Tor also accepts "byte" and "bit" in the singular\&. The prefixes "tera" and "T" are also recognized\&. If no units are given, we default to bytes\&. To avoid confusion, we recommend writing "bytes" or "bits" explicitly, since it\(cqs easy to forget that "B" means bytes, not bits\&.

.RS 4
If set, we will not advertise more than this amount of bandwidth for our BandwidthRate\&. Server operators who want to reduce the number of clients who ask to build circuits through them (since this is proportional to advertised bandwidth rate) can thus reduce the CPU demands on their server without impacting network performance\&.

If not 0, a separate token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage for _relayed traffic_ on this node to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value\&. Relayed traffic currently is calculated to include answers to directory requests, but that may change in future versions\&. They do not include directory fetches by the relay (from authority or other relays), because that is considered "client" activity\&. (Default: 0)

In its second form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client launches the pluggable transport proxy executable in

.RE
.PP
\fBConnLimit\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS 4
The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available to the Tor process before it will start\&. Tor will ask the OS for as many file descriptors as the OS will allow (you can find this by "ulimit \-H \-n")\&. If this number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to start\&.


Tor relays need thousands of sockets, to connect to every other relay\&. If you are running a private bridge, you can reduce the number of sockets that Tor uses\&. For example, to limit Tor to 500 sockets, run "ulimit \-n 500" in a shell\&. Then start tor in the same shell, with
\fBConnLimit 500\fR\&. You may also need to set
\fBDisableOOSCheck 0\fR\&.


Unless you have severely limited sockets, you probably don\(cqt need to adjust
\fBConnLimit\fR
itself\&. It has no effect on Windows, since that platform lacks getrlimit()\&. (Default: 1000)

.RS 4
When this option is set, we don\(cqt listen for or accept any connections other than controller connections, and we close (and don\(cqt reattempt) any outbound connections\&. Controllers sometimes use this option to avoid using the network until Tor is fully configured\&. Tor will make still certain network\-related calls (like DNS lookups) as a part of its configuration process, even if DisableNetwork is set\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the buffers for all sockets to the size specified in
\fBConstrainedSockSize\fR\&. This is useful for virtual servers and other environments where system level TCP buffers may be limited\&. If you\(cqre on a virtual server, and you encounter the "Error creating network socket: No buffer space available" message, you are likely experiencing this problem\&.


The preferred solution is to have the admin increase the buffer pool for the host itself via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility; this configuration option is a second\-resort\&.


The DirPort option should also not be used if TCP buffers are scarce\&. The cached directory requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates the problem\&.


You should
\fBnot\fR
enable this feature unless you encounter the "no buffer space available" issue\&. Reducing the TCP buffers affects window size for the TCP stream and will reduce throughput in proportion to round trip time on long paths\&. (Default: 0)
.RE

When
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR

If set, Tor will accept connections on this port and allow those connections to control the Tor process using the Tor Control Protocol (described in control\-spec\&.txt in
torspec)\&. Note: unless you also specify one or more of
\fBHashedControlPassword\fR
or
\fBCookieAuthentication\fR, setting this option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local host to control it\&. (Setting both authentication methods means either method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor\&.) This option is required for many Tor controllers; most use the value of 9051\&. If a unix domain socket is used, you may quote the path using standard C escape sequences\&. You can specify this directive multiple times, to bind to multiple address/port pairs\&. Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you\&. (Default: 0)

.RS 4
When tor is unable to connect to any directory cache for directory info (usually because it doesn\(cqt know about any yet) it tries a hard\-coded directory\&. Relays try one directory authority at a time\&. Clients try multiple directory authorities and FallbackDirs, to avoid hangs on startup if a hard\-coded directory is down\&. Clients wait for a few seconds between each attempt, and retry FallbackDirs more often than directory authorities, to reduce the load on the directory authorities\&.


FallbackDirs should be stable relays with stable IP addresses, ports, and identity keys\&. They must have a DirPort\&.


By default, the directory authorities are also FallbackDirs\&. Specifying a FallbackDir replaces Tor\(cqs default hard\-coded FallbackDirs (if any)\&. (See the

Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the provided address and port, with the specified key fingerprint\&. This option can be repeated many times, for multiple authoritative directory servers\&. Flags are separated by spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this directory is\&. By default, an authority is not authoritative for any directory style or version unless an appropriate flag is given\&.


Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative directory if the "bridge" flag is set\&. If a flag "orport=\fBorport\fR" is given, Tor will use the given port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver\&. If a flag "weight=\fBnum\fR" is given, then the directory server is chosen randomly with probability proportional to that weight (default 1\&.0)\&. If a flag "v3ident=\fBfp\fR" is given, the dirserver is a v3 directory authority whose v3 long\-term signing key has the fingerprint
\fBfp\fR\&. Lastly, if an "ipv6=\fB[\fR\fIipv6address\fR\fB]\fR:\fIorport\fR" flag is present, then the directory authority is listening for IPv6 connections on the indicated IPv6 address and OR Port\&.

To specify all IPv4 and IPv6 internal and link\-local networks (including 0\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 169\&.254\&.0\&.0/16, 127\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16, 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 172\&.16\&.0\&.0/12, [::]/8, [FC00::]/7, [FE80::]/10, [FEC0::]/10, [FF00::]/8, and [::]/127), you can use the "private" alias instead of an address\&. ("private" always produces rules for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, even when used with accept6/reject6\&.)


Private addresses are rejected by default (at the beginning of your exit policy), along with any configured primary public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&. These private addresses are rejected unless you set the ExitPolicyRejectPrivate config option to 0\&. For example, once you\(cqve done that, you could allow HTTP to 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 and block all other connections to internal networks with "accept 127\&.0\&.0\&.1:80,reject private:*", though that may also allow connections to your own computer that are addressed to its public (external) IP address\&. See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more details about internal and reserved IP address space\&. See ExitPolicyRejectLocalInterfaces if you want to block every address on the relay, even those that aren\(cqt advertised in the descriptor\&.


This directive can be specified multiple times so you don\(cqt have to put it all on one line\&.


Policies are considered first to last, and the first match wins\&. If you want to allow the same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules using accept/reject *\&. If you want to allow different ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your IPv6 rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules using accept/reject *4\&. If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end your exit policy with either a reject *:* or an accept *:*\&. Otherwise, you\(cqre _augmenting_ (prepending to) the default exit policy\&.


If you want to use a reduced exit policy rather than the default exit policy, set "ReducedExitPolicy 1"\&. If you want to
\fIreplace\fR
the default exit policy with your custom exit policy, end your exit policy with either a reject
\fB:\fR
or an accept
\fB:\fR\&. Otherwise, you\(cqre

Limits the max number of bytes sent and received within a set time period using a given calculation rule (see: AccountingStart, AccountingRule)\&. Useful if you need to stay under a specific bandwidth\&. By default, the number used for calculation is the max of either the bytes sent or received\&. For example, with AccountingMax set to 1 TByte, a server could send 900 GBytes and receive 800 GBytes and continue running\&. It will only hibernate once one of the two reaches 1 TByte\&. This can be changed to use the sum of the both bytes received and sent by setting the AccountingRule option to "sum" (total bandwidth in/out)\&. When the number of bytes remaining gets low, Tor will stop accepting new connections and circuits\&. When the number of bytes is exhausted, Tor will hibernate until some time in the next accounting period\&. To prevent all servers from waking at the same time, Tor will also wait until a random point in each period before waking up\&. If you have bandwidth cost issues, enabling hibernation is preferable to setting a low bandwidth, since it provides users with a collection of fast servers that are up some of the time, which is more useful than a set of slow servers that are always "available"\&.


Note that (as also described in the Bandwidth section) Tor uses powers of two, not powers of ten: 1 GByte is 1024*1024*1024, not one billion\&. Be careful: some internet service providers might count GBytes differently\&.

Tor has three built\-in mitigation options that can be individually enabled/disabled and fine\-tuned, but by default Tor directory authorities will define reasonable values for relays and no explicit configuration is required to make use of these protections\&. The mitigations take place at relays, and are as follows:
.sp

.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.el \{\

If a single client IP address (v4 or v6) makes circuits too quickly (default values are more than 3 per second, with an allowed burst of 90, see DoSCircuitCreationRate and DoSCircuitCreationBurst) while also having too many connections open (default is 3, see DoSCircuitCreationMinConnections), tor will refuse any new circuit (CREATE cells) for the next while (random value between 1 and 2 hours)\&.

"PROXY TCP6 fc00:dead:beef:4dad::ffff:ffff ::1 65535 42\er\en"


We encode the "global circuit identifier" as the last 32\-bits of the first IPv6 address\&. All other values in the header can safely be ignored\&. You can compute the global circuit identifier using the following formula given the IPv6 address "fc00:dead:beef:4dad::AABB:CCDD":


global_circuit_id = (0xAA << 24) + (0xBB << 16) + (0xCC << 8) + 0xDD;


In the case above, where the last 32\-bits are 0xffffffff, the global circuit identifier would be 4294967295\&.
