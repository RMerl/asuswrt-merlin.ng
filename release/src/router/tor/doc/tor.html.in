<p>tor -
   The second-generation onion router
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="content">
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>tor</strong> [<em>OPTION</em> <em>value</em>]&#8230;</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tor is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication
service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes, and
negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node
knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down
the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals
the downstream node.<br /></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers or relays ("onion routers").
Users bounce their TCP streams&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc.&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;around the
network, and recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have
difficulty tracking the source of the stream.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By default, <strong>tor</strong> will act as a client only.  To help the network
by providing bandwidth as a relay, change the <strong>ORPort</strong> configuration
option&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;see below.  Please also consult the documentation on the Tor
Project&#8217;s website.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_command_line_options">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="opt-h"></a> <strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Display a short help message and exit.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="opt-f"></a> <strong>-f</strong> <em>FILE</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Specify a new configuration file to contain further Tor configuration
    options OR pass <strong>-</strong> to make Tor read its configuration from standard
    input. (Default: @CONFDIR@/torrc, or $HOME/.torrc if that file is not
    found)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="opt-allow-missing-torrc"></a> <strong>--allow-missing-torrc</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Do not require that configuration file specified by <strong>-f</strong> exist if
    default torrc can be accessed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="opt-defaults-torrc"></a> <strong>--defaults-torrc</strong> <em>FILE</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Specify a file in which to find default values for Tor options.  The
    contents of this file are overridden by those in the regular
    configuration file, and by those on the command line. (Default:
    @CONFDIR@/torrc-defaults.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="opt-ignore-missing-torrc"></a> <strong>--ignore-missing-torrc</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Specifies that Tor should treat a missing torrc file as though it
    were empty. Ordinarily, Tor does this for missing default torrc files,
    but not for those specified on the command line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="opt-hash-password"></a> <strong>--hash-password</strong> <em>PASSWORD</em>

<br />
   The <strong>--newpass</strong> option should be used with --keygen only when you need
   to add, change, or remove a passphrase on an existing ed25519 master
   identity key. You will be prompted for the old passphase (if any),
   and the new passphrase (if any).<br />
<br />
   When generating a master key, you will probably want to use
   <strong>--DataDirectory</strong> to control where the keys
   and certificates will be stored, and <strong>--SigningKeyLifetime</strong> to
   control their lifetimes.  Their behavior is as documented in the
   server options section below.  (You must have write access to the specified
   DataDirectory.)<br />

<div class="paragraph"><p>Other options can be specified on the command-line in the format "--option

instance, you can tell Tor to start listening for SOCKS connections on port
9999 by passing --SocksPort 9999 or SocksPort 9999 to it on the command line,
or by putting "SocksPort 9999" in the configuration file.  You will need to
quote options with spaces in them: if you want Tor to log all debugging
messages to debug.log, you will probably need to say <strong>--Log</strong> <code>"debug file
debug.log"</code>.</p></div>

<h2 id="_the_configuration_file_format">THE CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>All configuration options in a configuration are written on a single line by
default.  They take the form of an option name and a value, or an option name
and a quoted value (option value or option "value"). Anything after a #
character is treated as a comment.  Options are
case-insensitive. C-style escaped characters are allowed inside quoted
values. To split one configuration entry into multiple lines, use a single
backslash character (\) before the end of the line.  Comments can be used in
such multiline entries, but they must start at the beginning of a line.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Configuration options can be imported from files or folders using the %include
option with the value being a path. If the path is a file, the options from the
file will be parsed as if they were written where the %include option is. If
the path is a folder, all files on that folder will be parsed following lexical
order. Files starting with a dot are ignored. Files on subfolders are ignored.
The %include option can be used recursively.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By default, an option on the command line overrides an option found in the
configuration file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in
the defaults file.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This rule is simple for options that take a single value, but it can become
complicated for options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you
specify four SocksPorts in your configuration file, and one more SocksPort on
the command line, the option on the command line will replace <em>all</em> of the
SocksPorts in the configuration file.  If this isn&#8217;t what you want, prefix
the option name with a plus sign (+), and it will be appended to the previous
set of options instead.  For example, setting SocksPort 9100 will use only
port 9100, but setting +SocksPort 9100 will use ports 9100 and 9050 (because
this is the default).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Alternatively, you might want to remove every instance of an option in the
configuration file, and not replace it at all: you might want to say on the
command line that you want no SocksPorts at all.  To do that, prefix the
option name with a forward slash (/).  You can use the plus sign (+) and the
forward slash (/) in the configuration file and on the command line.</p></div>

    A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node
    to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing
    bandwidth usage to that same value.  If you want to run a relay in the
    public network, this needs to be <em>at the very least</em> 75 KBytes for a
    relay (that is, 600 kbits) or 50 KBytes for a bridge (400 kbits)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but of
    course, more is better; we recommend at least 250 KBytes (2 mbits) if
    possible.  (Default: 1 GByte)<br />
<br />
    Note that this option, and other bandwidth-limiting options, apply to TCP
    data only: They do not count TCP headers or DNS traffic.<br />
<br />
    Tor uses powers of two, not powers of ten, so 1 GByte is
    1024*1024*1024 bytes as opposed to 1 billion bytes.<br />
<br />
    With this option, and in other options that take arguments in bytes,
    KBytes, and so on, other formats are also supported. Notably, "KBytes" can
    also be written as "kilobytes" or "kb"; "MBytes" can be written as
    "megabytes" or "MB"; "kbits" can be written as "kilobits"; and so forth.
    Case doesn&#8217;t matter.
    Tor also accepts "byte" and "bit" in the singular.
    The prefixes "tera" and "T" are also recognized.
    If no units are given, we default to bytes.
    To avoid confusion, we recommend writing "bytes" or "bits" explicitly,

    If this number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to start.<br />
<br />
    Tor relays need thousands of sockets, to connect to every other relay.
    If you are running a private bridge, you can reduce the number of sockets
    that Tor uses. For example, to limit Tor to 500 sockets, run
    "ulimit -n 500" in a shell. Then start tor in the same shell, with
    <strong>ConnLimit 500</strong>. You may also need to set <strong>DisableOOSCheck 0</strong>.<br />

    Unless you have severely limited sockets, you probably don&#8217;t need to

    If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the buffers for all
    sockets to the size specified in <strong>ConstrainedSockSize</strong>. This is useful for
    virtual servers and other environments where system level TCP buffers may
    be limited. If you&#8217;re on a virtual server, and you encounter the "Error
    creating network socket: No buffer space available" message, you are
    likely experiencing this problem.<br />
<br />
    The preferred solution is to have the admin increase the buffer pool for
    the host itself via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility;
    this configuration option is a second-resort.<br />
<br />
    The DirPort option should also not be used if TCP buffers are scarce. The
    cached directory requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates
    the problem.<br />
<br />
    You should <strong>not</strong> enable this feature unless you encounter the "no buffer

<p>
    When tor is unable to connect to any directory cache for directory info
    (usually because it doesn&#8217;t know about any yet) it tries a hard-coded
    directory. Relays try one directory authority at a time. Clients try
    multiple directory authorities and FallbackDirs, to avoid hangs on
    startup if a hard-coded directory is down. Clients wait for a few seconds
    between each attempt, and retry FallbackDirs more often than directory
    authorities, to reduce the load on the directory authorities. <br />
<br />
    FallbackDirs should be stable relays with stable IP addresses, ports,
    and identity keys. They must have a DirPort.<br />
<br />
    By default, the directory authorities are also FallbackDirs. Specifying a
    FallbackDir replaces Tor&#8217;s default hard-coded FallbackDirs (if any).

    Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the provided address
    and port, with the specified key fingerprint. This option can be repeated
    many times, for multiple authoritative directory servers. Flags are
    separated by spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this directory
    is. By default, an authority is not authoritative for any directory style
    or version unless an appropriate flag is given.<br />
<br />
    Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative directory if the
    "bridge" flag is set. If a flag "orport=<strong>orport</strong>" is given, Tor will
    use the given port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver. If a
    flag "weight=<strong>num</strong>" is given, then the directory server is chosen
    randomly with probability proportional to that weight (default 1.0). If a
    flag "v3ident=<strong>fp</strong>" is given, the dirserver is a v3 directory authority
    whose v3 long-term signing key has the fingerprint <strong>fp</strong>. Lastly,
    if an "ipv6=<strong>[</strong><em>ipv6address</em><strong>]</strong>:<em>orport</em>" flag is present, then
    the directory authority is listening for IPv6 connections on the
    indicated IPv6 address and OR Port.<br />
<br />
    Tor will contact the authority at <em>ipv4address</em> to
    download directory documents. Clients always use the ORPort. Relays
    usually use the DirPort, but will use the ORPort in some circumstances.
    If an IPv6 ORPort is supplied, clients will also download directory
    documents at the IPv6 ORPort, if they are configured to use IPv6.<br />
<br />
    If no <strong>DirAuthority</strong> line is given, Tor will use the default directory
    authorities. NOTE: this option is intended for setting up a private Tor
    network with its own directory authorities. If you use it, you will be
    distinguishable from other users, because you won&#8217;t believe the same

<br />
    The possible scheduler types are:
<br />
    <strong>KIST</strong>: Kernel-Informed Socket Transport. Tor will use TCP information
    from the kernel to make informed decisions regarding how much data to send
    and when to send it. KIST also handles traffic in batches (see
    KISTSchedRunInterval) in order to improve traffic prioritization decisions.
    As implemented, KIST will only work on Linux kernel version 2.6.39 or
    higher.
<br />
    <strong>KISTLite</strong>: Same as KIST but without kernel support. Tor will use all
    the same mechanics as with KIST, including the batching, but its decisions
    regarding how much data to send will not be as good. KISTLite will work on
    all kernels and operating systems, and the majority of the benefits of KIST
    are still realized with KISTLite.

    If "transport" is provided, it must match a ClientTransportPlugin line. We

    transport-specific method to work out the remote address to connect to.
    These transports typically ignore the "IP:ORPort" specified in the bridge
    line. <br />

    Tor passes any "key=val" settings to the pluggable transport proxy as

    A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address
    patterns of nodes to avoid when building a circuit. Country codes are

    (Example:
    ExcludeNodes ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234, {cc}, 255.254.0.0/8)<br />
<br />
    By default, this option is treated as a preference that Tor is allowed
    to override in order to keep working.
    For example, if you try to connect to a hidden service,
    but you have excluded all of the hidden service&#8217;s introduction points,
    Tor will connect to one of them anyway.  If you do not want this
    behavior, set the StrictNodes option (documented below). <br />
<br />
    Note also that if you are a relay, this (and the other node selection
    options below) only affects your own circuits that Tor builds for you.
    Clients can still build circuits through you to any node.  Controllers
    can tell Tor to build circuits through any node.<br />
<br />
    Country codes are case-insensitive. The code "{??}" refers to nodes whose
    country can&#8217;t be identified. No country code, including {??}, works if
    no GeoIPFile can be loaded. See also the GeoIPExcludeUnknown option below.

<br />
    Note that if you list too few nodes here, or if you exclude too many exit

    if none of the exits you list allows traffic on port 80 or 443, you won&#8217;t
    be able to browse the web.<br />
<br />
    Note also that not every circuit is used to deliver traffic <strong>outside</strong> of
    the Tor network.  It is normal to see non-exit circuits (such as those
    used to connect to hidden services, those that do directory fetches,
    those used for relay reachability self-tests, and so on) that end
    at a non-exit node.  To

<p>
    A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running connections
    (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for streams that use these
    ports will contain only high-uptime nodes, to reduce the chance that a node
    will go down before the stream is finished. Note that the list is also
    honored for circuits (both client and service side) involving hidden
    services whose virtual port is in this list. (Default: 21, 22, 706,
    1863, 5050, 5190, 5222, 5223, 6523, 6667, 6697, 8300)

<a id="MapAddress"></a> <strong>MapAddress</strong> <em>address</em> <em>newaddress</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When a request for address arrives to Tor, it will transform to newaddress
    before processing it. For example, if you always want connections to
    www.example.com to exit via <em>torserver</em> (where <em>torserver</em> is the
    fingerprint of the server), use "MapAddress www.example.com
    www.example.com.torserver.exit". If the value is prefixed with a
    "*.", matches an entire domain. For example, if you
    always want connections to example.com and any if its subdomains
    to exit via
    <em>torserver</em> (where <em>torserver</em> is the fingerprint of the server), use
    "MapAddress *.example.com *.example.com.torserver.exit". (Note the
    leading "*." in each part of the directive.) You can also redirect all
    subdomains of a domain to a single address. For example, "MapAddress
    *.example.com www.example.com". If the specified exit is not available,
    or the exit can not connect to the site, Tor will fail any connections
    to the mapped address.+
<br />
    NOTES:
</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
When evaluating MapAddress expressions Tor stops when it hits the most
    recently added expression that matches the requested address. So if you
    have the following in your torrc, www.torproject.org will map to
    198.51.100.1:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>MapAddress www.torproject.org 192.0.2.1
MapAddress www.torproject.org 198.51.100.1</code></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tor evaluates the MapAddress configuration until it finds no matches. So
    if you have the following in your torrc, www.torproject.org will map to
    203.0.113.1:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>MapAddress 198.51.100.1 203.0.113.1
MapAddress www.torproject.org 198.51.100.1</code></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The following MapAddress expression is invalid (and will be
    ignored) because you cannot map from a specific address to a wildcard
    address:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>MapAddress www.torproject.org *.torproject.org.torserver.exit</code></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Using a wildcard to match only part of a string (as in *ample.com) is
    also invalid.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tor maps hostnames and IP addresses separately. If you MapAddress
       a DNS name, but use an IP address to connect, then Tor will ignore the
       DNS name mapping.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
MapAddress does not apply to redirects in the application protocol.
       For example, HTTP redirects and alt-svc headers will ignore mappings
       for the original address. You can use a wildcard mapping to handle
       redirects within the same site.

<br />
        NOTE: Although this option allows you to specify an IP address
        other than localhost, you should do so only with extreme caution.
        The SOCKS protocol is unencrypted and (as we use it)
        unauthenticated, so exposing it in this way could leak your
        information to anybody watching your network, and allow anybody
        to use your computer as an open proxy.<br />

    If multiple entries of this option are present in your configuration
    file, Tor will perform stream isolation between listeners by default.
    The <em>isolation flags</em> arguments give Tor rules for which streams

    When Tor needs to assign a virtual (unused) address because of a MAPADDRESS
    command from the controller or the AutomapHostsOnResolve feature, Tor
    picks an unassigned address from this range. (Defaults:
    127.192.0.0/10 and [FE80::]/10 respectively.)<br />
<br />
    When providing proxy server service to a network of computers using a tool
    like dns-proxy-tor, change the IPv4 network to "10.192.0.0/10" or
    "172.16.0.0/12" and change the IPv6 network to "[FC00::]/7".
    The default <strong>VirtualAddrNetwork</strong> address ranges on a
    properly configured machine will route to the loopback or link-local

    activity, and Tor will never start in Dormant mode, even if it has
    been unused for a long time on previous runs. (Default: 0)
<br />
    Note: Packagers and application developers should change the value of
    this option only with great caution: it has the potential to
    create spurious traffic on the network.  This option should only
    be used if Tor is started by an affirmative user activity (like
    clicking on an applcation or running a command), and not if Tor
    is launched for some other reason (for example, by a startup
    process, or by an application that launches itself on every login.)

<a id="ExitRelay"></a> <strong>ExitRelay</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>|<strong>auto</strong>

<p>
    Tells Tor whether to run as an exit relay.  If Tor is running as a
    non-bridge server, and ExitRelay is set to 1, then Tor allows traffic to
    exit according to the ExitPolicy option, the ReducedExitPolicy option,
    or the default ExitPolicy (if no other exit policy option is specified).<br />
<br />
    If ExitRelay is set to 0, no traffic is allowed to exit, and the
    ExitPolicy, ReducedExitPolicy, and IPv6Exit options are ignored.<br />
<br />
    If ExitRelay is set to "auto", then Tor checks the ExitPolicy,
    ReducedExitPolicy, and IPv6Exit options. If at least one of these options
    is set, Tor behaves as if ExitRelay were set to 1. If none of these exit
    policy options are set, Tor behaves as if ExitRelay were set to 0.
    (Default: auto)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="ExitPolicy"></a> <strong>ExitPolicy</strong> <em>policy</em>,<em>policy</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Set an exit policy for this server. Each policy is of the form
    "<strong>accept[6]</strong>|<strong>reject[6]</strong>  <em>ADDR</em>[/<em>MASK</em>][:<em>PORT</em>]". If /<em>MASK</em> is
    omitted then this policy just applies to the host given. Instead of giving
    a host or network you can also use "*" to denote the universe (0.0.0.0/0
    and ::/0), or *4 to denote all IPv4 addresses, and *6 to denote all IPv6
    addresses.
    <em>PORT</em> can be a single port number, an interval of ports
    "<em>FROM_PORT</em>-<em>TO_PORT</em>", or "*". If <em>PORT</em> is omitted, that means
    "*".<br />
<br />
    For example, "accept 18.7.22.69:*,reject 18.0.0.0/8:*,accept *:*" would
    reject any IPv4 traffic destined for MIT except for web.mit.edu, and accept
    any other IPv4 or IPv6 traffic.<br />
<br />
    Tor also allows IPv6 exit policy entries. For instance, "reject6 [FC00::]/7:*"
    rejects all destinations that share 7 most significant bit prefix with
    address FC00::. Respectively, "accept6 [C000::]/3:*" accepts all destinations
    that share 3 most significant bit prefix with address C000::.<br />
<br />
    accept6 and reject6 only produce IPv6 exit policy entries. Using an IPv4
    address with accept6 or reject6 is ignored and generates a warning.
    accept/reject allows either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Use *4 as an IPv4
    wildcard address, and *6 as an IPv6 wildcard address. accept/reject *
    expands to matching IPv4 and IPv6 wildcard address rules.<br />
<br />
    To specify all IPv4 and IPv6 internal and link-local networks (including
    0.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16, 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8,
    172.16.0.0/12, [::]/8, [FC00::]/7, [FE80::]/10, [FEC0::]/10, [FF00::]/8,
    and [::]/127), you can use the "private" alias instead of an address.
    ("private" always produces rules for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, even when
    used with accept6/reject6.)<br />
<br />
    Private addresses are rejected by default (at the beginning of your exit
    policy), along with any configured primary public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    These private addresses are rejected unless you set the
    ExitPolicyRejectPrivate config option to 0. For example, once you&#8217;ve done
    that, you could allow HTTP to 127.0.0.1 and block all other connections to
    internal networks with "accept 127.0.0.1:80,reject private:*", though that
    may also allow connections to your own computer that are addressed to its
    public (external) IP address. See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more details
    about internal and reserved IP address space. See
    ExitPolicyRejectLocalInterfaces if you want to block every address on the
    relay, even those that aren&#8217;t advertised in the descriptor.<br />
<br />
    This directive can be specified multiple times so you don&#8217;t have to put it
    all on one line.<br />
<br />
    Policies are considered first to last, and the first match wins. If you
    want to allow the same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules using
    accept/reject *. If you want to allow different ports on IPv4 and IPv6,
    write your IPv6 rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules using
    accept/reject *4. If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end
    your exit policy with either a reject *:* or an accept *:*. Otherwise,
    you&#8217;re _augmenting_ (prepending to) the default exit policy.<br />
<br />
    If you want to use a reduced exit policy rather than the default exit
    policy, set "ReducedExitPolicy 1". If you want to <em>replace</em> the default
    exit policy with your custom exit policy, end your exit policy with either
    a reject <strong>:</strong> or an accept <strong>:</strong>. Otherwise, you&#8217;re <em>augmenting</em> (prepending
    to) the default or reduced exit policy.<br />
<br />
    The default exit policy is:

    public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on any interface on the relay. (If IPv6Exit
    is not set, all IPv6 addresses will be rejected anyway.)
    See above entry on ExitPolicy.

    The reduced exit policy is an alternative to the default exit policy. It
    allows as many Internet services as possible while still blocking the
    majority of TCP ports. Currently, the policy allows approximately 65 ports.

<p>
    Limits the max number of bytes sent and received within a set time period
    using a given calculation rule (see: AccountingStart, AccountingRule).
    Useful if you need to stay under a specific bandwidth. By default, the
    number used for calculation is the max of either the bytes sent or
    received. For example, with AccountingMax set to 1 TByte, a server
    could send 900 GBytes and receive 800 GBytes and continue running.
    It will only hibernate once one of the two reaches 1 TByte. This can
    be changed to use the sum of the both bytes received and sent by setting
    the AccountingRule option to "sum" (total bandwidth in/out). When the
    number of bytes remaining gets low, Tor will stop accepting new connections
    and circuits. When the number of bytes is exhausted, Tor will hibernate
    until some time in the next accounting period. To prevent all servers
    from waking at the same time, Tor will also wait until a random point
    in each period before waking up. If you have bandwidth cost issues,
    enabling hibernation is preferable to setting a low bandwidth, since
    it provides users with a collection of fast servers that are up some
    of the time, which is more useful than a set of slow servers that are
    always "available".<br />
<br />
    Note that (as also described in the Bandwidth section) Tor uses
    powers of two, not powers of ten: 1 GByte is 1024*1024*1024, not
    one billion. Be careful: some internet service providers might count
    GBytes differently.

   The onion service will use the given protocol to expose the global circuit
   identifier of each inbound client circuit. The only
   protocol supported right now 'haproxy'. This option is only for v3
   services. (Default: none)<br />
<br />
   The haproxy option works in the following way: when the feature is
   enabled, the Tor process will write a header line when a client is connecting
   to the onion service. The header will look like this:<br />
<br />
   "PROXY TCP6 fc00:dead:beef:4dad::ffff:ffff ::1 65535 42\r\n"<br />
<br />
   We encode the "global circuit identifier" as the last 32-bits of the first
   IPv6 address. All other values in the header can safely be ignored. You can
   compute the global circuit identifier using the following formula given the
   IPv6 address "fc00:dead:beef:4dad::AABB:CCDD":<br />
<br />
      global_circuit_id = (0xAA &lt;&lt; 24) + (0xBB &lt;&lt; 16) + (0xCC &lt;&lt; 8) + 0xDD;<br />
<br />
   In the case above, where the last 32-bits are 0xffffffff, the global circuit
   identifier would be 4294967295. You can use this value together with Tor&#8217;s
   control port to terminate particular circuits using their global
   circuit identifiers. For more information about this see control-spec.txt.<br />

<dd>
<p>
   The maximum number of simultaneous streams (connections) per rendezvous
   circuit. The maximum value allowed is 65535. (Setting this to 0 will allow
   an unlimited number of simultaneous streams.) (Default: 0)

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceMaxStreamsCloseCircuit"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceMaxStreamsCloseCircuit</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   If set to 1, then exceeding <strong>HiddenServiceMaxStreams</strong> will cause the
   offending rendezvous circuit to be torn down, as opposed to stream creation
   requests that exceed the limit being silently ignored. (Default: 0)

</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Every time the specified period elapses, Tor uploads any rendezvous
    service descriptors to the directory servers. This information is also
    uploaded whenever it changes. Minimum value allowed is 10 minutes and
    maximum is 3.5 days. This option is only for v2 services.
    (Default: 1 hour)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceDirGroupReadable"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceDirGroupReadable</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If this option is set to 1, allow the filesystem group to read the
    hidden service directory and hostname file. If the option is set to 0,
    only owner is able to read the hidden service directory. (Default: 0)
    Has no effect on Windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceNumIntroductionPoints"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceNumIntroductionPoints</strong> <em>NUM</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Number of introduction points the hidden service will have. You can&#8217;t
    have more than 10 for v2 service and 20 for v3. (Default: 3)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSDefense"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSDefense</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Enable DoS defense at the intropoint level. When this is enabled, the
    rate and burst parameter (see below) will be sent to the intro point which
    will then use them to apply rate limiting for introduction request to this
    service.
 <br />
    The introduction point honors the consensus parameters except if this is
    specifically set by the service operator using this option. The service
    never looks at the consensus parameters in order to enable or disable this
    defense. (Default: 0)

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSRatePerSec"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSRatePerSec</strong> <em>NUM</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The allowed client introduction rate per second at the introduction
    point. If this option is 0, it is considered infinite and thus if
    <strong>HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSDefense</strong> is set, it then effectively
    disables the defenses. (Default: 25)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSBurstPerSec"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSBurstPerSec</strong> <em>NUM</em>
</dt>

    If set to 0, Tor will run any hidden services you configure, but it won&#8217;t
    advertise them to the rendezvous directory. This option is only useful if
    you&#8217;re using a Tor controller that handles hidserv publishing for you.

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceSingleHopMode"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceSingleHopMode</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    <strong>Experimental - Non Anonymous</strong> Hidden Services on a tor instance in
    HiddenServiceSingleHopMode make one-hop (direct) circuits between the onion
    service server, and the introduction and rendezvous points. (Onion service
    descriptors are still posted using 3-hop paths, to avoid onion service
    directories blocking the service.)
    This option makes every hidden service instance hosted by a tor instance a
    Single Onion Service. One-hop circuits make Single Onion servers easily
    locatable, but clients remain location-anonymous. However, the fact that a
    client is accessing a Single Onion rather than a Hidden Service may be
    statistically distinguishable.<br />
<br />
    <strong>WARNING:</strong> Once a hidden service directory has been used by a tor
    instance in HiddenServiceSingleHopMode, it can <strong>NEVER</strong> be used again for
    a hidden service. It is best practice to create a new hidden service
    directory, key, and address for each new Single Onion Service and Hidden
    Service. It is not possible to run Single Onion Services and Hidden
    Services from the same tor instance: they should be run on different
    servers with different IP addresses.<br />
<br />
    HiddenServiceSingleHopMode requires HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode to be set
    to 1. Since a Single Onion service is non-anonymous, you can not configure
    a SOCKSPort on a tor instance that is running in
    <strong>HiddenServiceSingleHopMode</strong>. Can not be changed while tor is running.
    (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<a id="HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode"></a> <strong>HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>

<p>
    Makes hidden services non-anonymous on this tor instance. Allows the
    non-anonymous HiddenServiceSingleHopMode. Enables direct connections in the
    server-side hidden service protocol.  If you are using this option,
    you need to disable all client-side services on your Tor instance,
    including setting SOCKSPort to "0". Can not be changed while tor is
    running. (Default: 0)

<dd>
<p>
    These files hold downloaded router statuses. Some routers may appear more
    than once; if so, the most recently published descriptor is used. Lines
    beginning with @-signs are annotations that contain more information about
    a given router. The ".new" file is an append-only journal; when it gets

<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>DataDirectory</em><strong>/bw_accounting</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Used to track bandwidth accounting values (when the current period starts

<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>DataDirectory</em><strong>/key-pinning-journal</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Used by authorities. A line-based file that records mappings between
    RSA1024 identity keys and Ed25519 identity keys. Authorities enforce
    these mappings, so that once a relay has picked an Ed25519 key, stealing
    or factoring the RSA1024 key will no longer let an attacker impersonate
    the relay.
</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>KeyDirectory</em><strong>/authority_identity_key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A v3 directory authority&#8217;s master identity key, used to authenticate its

<dd>
<p>
    A v3 directory authority&#8217;s certificate, which authenticates the authority&#8217;s

</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The private part of a relay&#8217;s Ed25519 permanent identity key.  This key
    is used to sign the medium-term ed25519 signing key.  This file can be
    kept offline, or kept encrypted. If so, Tor will not be able to generate
    new signing keys itself; you&#8217;ll need to use tor --keygen yourself to do
    so.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>KeyDirectory</em><strong>/ed25519_signing_secret_key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The private and public components of a relay&#8217;s medium-term Ed25519 signing
    key. This key is authenticated by the Ed25519 master key, in turn
    authenticates other keys (and router descriptors).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>KeyDirectory</em><strong>/ed25519_signing_cert</strong>

<em>KeyDirectory</em><strong>/secret_onion_key</strong> and <strong>secret_onion_key.old</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A relay&#8217;s RSA1024 short-term onion key. Used to decrypt old-style ("TAP")
    circuit extension requests. The ".old" file holds the previously
    generated key, which the relay uses to handle any requests that were
    made by clients that didn&#8217;t have the new one.

<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>KeyDirectory</em><strong>/secret_onion_key_ntor</strong> and <strong>secret_onion_key_ntor.old</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A relay&#8217;s Curve25519 short-term onion key. Used to handle modern ("ntor")
    circuit extension requests. The ".old" file holds the previously

<dd>
<p>
    Only used by authoritative directory servers. This file lists
    the status of routers by their identity fingerprint.
    Each line lists a status and a fingerprint separated by
    whitespace. See your <strong>fingerprint</strong> file in the <em>DataDirectory</em> for an
    example line. If the status is <strong>!reject</strong> then descriptors from the
    given identity (fingerprint) are rejected by this server. If it is
    <strong>!invalid</strong> then descriptors are accepted but marked in the directory as
    not valid, that is, not recommended.
</p>

    The &lt;base32-encoded-fingerprint&gt;.onion domain name for this hidden service.
    If the hidden service is restricted to authorized clients only, this file
    also contains authorization data for all clients.
<br />
    Note that clients will ignore any extra subdomains prepended to a hidden
    service hostname. So if you have "xyz.onion" as your hostname, you
    can tell clients to connect to "www.xyz.onion" or "irc.xyz.onion"
    for virtual-hosting purposes.
