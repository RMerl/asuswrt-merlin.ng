 *     but haven't gotten a response yet.
 *   circuits that are c_establish_rend are either on their way
 *     to becoming open, or they are open and have sent the
 *     establish_rendezvous cell but haven't received an ack.
 *   circuits that are c_rend_ready are open and have received a
 *     rend ack, but haven't heard from the service yet. if they have a
 *     buildstate->pending_final_cpath then they're expecting a
 *     cell from the service, else they're not.
 *   circuits that are c_rend_ready_intro_acked are open, and
 *     some intro circ has sent its intro and received an ack.
 *   circuits that are c_rend_joined are open, have heard from
 *     the service, and are talking to it.
