/**
 * \file circuituse.c
 * \brief Launch the right sort of circuits and attach the right streams to
 * them.
 *
 * As distinct from circuitlist.c, which manages lookups to find circuits, and
 * circuitbuild.c, which handles the logistics of circuit construction, this
 * module keeps track of which streams can be attached to which circuits (in
 * circuit_get_best()), and attaches streams to circuits (with
 * circuit_try_attaching_streams(), connection_ap_handshake_attach_circuit(),
 * and connection_ap_handshake_attach_chosen_circuit() ).
 *
 * This module also makes sure that we are building circuits for all of the
 * predicted ports, using circuit_remove_handled_ports(),
 * circuit_stream_is_being_handled(), and circuit_build_needed_cirs().  It
 * handles launching circuits for specific targets using
 * circuit_launch_by_extend_info().
 *
 * This is also where we handle expiring circuits that have been around for
 * too long without actually completing, along with the circuit_build_timeout
 * logic in circuitstats.c.
