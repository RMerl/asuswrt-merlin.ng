/** Description of a connection to another host or process, and associated
 * data.
 *
 * A connection is named based on what it's connected to -- an "OR
 * connection" has a Tor node on the other end, an "exit
 * connection" has a website or other server on the other end, and an
 * "AP connection" has an application proxy (and thus a user) on the
 * other end.
 *
 * Every connection has a type and a state.  Connections never change
 * their type, but can go through many state changes in their lifetime.
 *
 * Every connection has two associated input and output buffers.
 * Listeners don't use them.  For non-listener connections, incoming
 * data is appended to conn->inbuf, and outgoing data is taken from
 * conn->outbuf.  Connections differ primarily in the functions called
 * to fill and drain these buffers.

   * TCP (for example, a UDP dns request, or a controller resolve request),

   *    * Setting it on linked connections, possibly.
   *    * Updating it based on the Forwarded-For header-- Forwarded-For is
   *      set by a proxy, but not a local trusted proxy.
