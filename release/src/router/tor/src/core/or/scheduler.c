/**
 * \file scheduler.c
 * \brief Channel scheduling system: decides which channels should send and
 * receive when.
 *
 * This module is the global/common parts of the scheduling system. This system
 * is what decides what channels get to send cells on their circuits and when.
 *
 * Terms:
 * - "Scheduling system": the collection of scheduler*.{h,c} files and their
 *   aggregate behavior.
 * - "Scheduler implementation": a scheduler_t. The scheduling system has one
 *   active scheduling implementation at a time.
 *
 * In this file you will find state that any scheduler implementation can have
 * access to as well as the functions the rest of Tor uses to interact with the
 * scheduling system.
 *
 * The earliest versions of Tor approximated a kind of round-robin system
 * among active connections, but only approximated it. It would only consider
 * one connection (roughly equal to a channel in today's terms) at a time, and
 * thus could only prioritize circuits against others on the same connection.
 *
 * Then in response to the KIST paper[0], Tor implemented a global
 * circuit scheduler. It was supposed to prioritize circuits across many
 * channels, but wasn't effective. It is preserved in scheduler_vanilla.c.
 *
 * [0]: http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/kist-sec2014.pdf
 *
 * Then we actually got around to implementing KIST for real. We decided to
 * modularize the scheduler so new ones can be implemented. You can find KIST
 * in scheduler_kist.c.
 *
 * Channels have one of four scheduling states based on whether or not they
 * have cells to send and whether or not they are able to send.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *   Not open for writes, no cells to send.
 *     <ul><li> Not much to do here, and the channel will have scheduler_state
 *       == SCHED_CHAN_IDLE
 *     <li> Transitions from:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li>Open for writes/has cells by simultaneously draining all circuit
 *         queues and filling the output buffer.
 *       </ul>
 *     <li> Transitions to:
 *      <ul>
 *       <li> Not open for writes/has cells by arrival of cells on an attached
 *         circuit (this would be driven from append_cell_to_circuit_queue())
 *       <li> Open for writes/no cells by a channel type specific path;
 *         driven from connection_or_flushed_some() for channel_tls_t.
 *      </ul>
 *    </ul>
 *
 * <li> Open for writes, no cells to send
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>Not much here either; this will be the state an idle but open
 *       channel can be expected to settle in.  It will have scheduler_state
 *       == SCHED_CHAN_WAITING_FOR_CELLS
 *     <li> Transitions from:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li>Not open for writes/no cells by flushing some of the output
 *         buffer.
 *       <li>Open for writes/has cells by the scheduler moving cells from
 *         circuit queues to channel output queue, but not having enough
 *         to fill the output queue.
 *       </ul>
 *     <li> Transitions to:
 *       <ul>
 *        <li>Open for writes/has cells by arrival of new cells on an attached
 *         circuit, in append_cell_to_circuit_queue()
 *       </ul>
 *     </ul>
 *
 * <li>Not open for writes, cells to send
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>This is the state of a busy circuit limited by output bandwidth;
 *       cells have piled up in the circuit queues waiting to be relayed.
 *       The channel will have scheduler_state == SCHED_CHAN_WAITING_TO_WRITE.
 *     <li> Transitions from:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li>Not open for writes/no cells by arrival of cells on an attached
 *         circuit
 *       <li>Open for writes/has cells by filling an output buffer without
 *         draining all cells from attached circuits
 *       </ul>
 *    <li> Transitions to:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li>Opens for writes/has cells by draining some of the output buffer
 *         via the connection_or_flushed_some() path (for channel_tls_t).
 *       </ul>
 *    </ul>
 *
 * <li>Open for writes, cells to send
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>This connection is ready to relay some cells and waiting for
 *       the scheduler to choose it.  The channel will have scheduler_state ==
 *       SCHED_CHAN_PENDING.
 *     <li>Transitions from:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li>Not open for writes/has cells by the connection_or_flushed_some()
 *         path
 *       <li>Open for writes/no cells by the append_cell_to_circuit_queue()
 *         path
 *       </ul>
 *     <li> Transitions to:
 *       <ul>
 *        <li>Not open for writes/no cells by draining all circuit queues and
 *          simultaneously filling the output buffer.
 *        <li>Not open for writes/has cells by writing enough cells to fill the
 *         output buffer
 *        <li>Open for writes/no cells by draining all attached circuit queues
 *         without also filling the output buffer
 *       </ul>
 *    </ul>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Other event-driven parts of the code move channels between these scheduling
 * states by calling scheduler functions. The scheduling system builds up a
 * list of channels in the SCHED_CHAN_PENDING state that the scheduler
 * implementation should then use when it runs. Scheduling implementations need
 * to properly update channel states during their scheduler_t->run() function
 * as that is the only opportunity for channels to move from SCHED_CHAN_PENDING
 * to any other state.
 *
 * The remainder of this file is a small amount of state that any scheduler
 * implementation should have access to, and the functions the rest of Tor uses
 * to interact with the scheduling system.
