   * sock_buf_size_factor value of 1.0, we allow at most 2*cwnd bytes to sit in
   * the kernel: 1 cwnd on the wire waiting for ACKs and 1 cwnd ready and
   * waiting to be sent when those ACKs finally come.
   *
   * In the below diagram, we see some bytes in the TCP-space (denoted by '*')
   * that have be sent onto the wire and are waiting for ACKs. We have a little
   * more room in "TCP space" that we can fill with data that will be
