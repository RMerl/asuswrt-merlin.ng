/**
 * \file entrynodes.c
 * \brief Code to manage our fixed first nodes for various functions.
 *
 * Entry nodes can be guards (for general use) or bridges (for censorship
 * circumvention).
 *
 * In general, we use entry guards to prevent traffic-sampling attacks:
 * if we chose every circuit independently, an adversary controlling
 * some fraction of paths on the network would observe a sample of every
 * user's traffic. Using guards gives users a chance of not being
 * profiled.
 *
 * The current entry guard selection code is designed to try to avoid
 * _ever_ trying every guard on the network, to try to stick to guards
 * that we've used before, to handle hostile/broken networks, and
 * to behave sanely when the network goes up and down.
 *
 * Our algorithm works as follows: First, we maintain a SAMPLE of guards
 * we've seen in the networkstatus consensus.  We maintain this sample
 * over time, and store it persistently; it is chosen without reference
 * to our configuration or firewall rules.  Guards remain in the sample
 * as they enter and leave the consensus.  We expand this sample as
 * needed, up to a maximum size.
 *
 * As a subset of the sample, we maintain a FILTERED SET of the guards
 * that we would be willing to use if we could connect to them.  The
 * filter removes all the guards that we're excluding because they're
 * bridges (or not bridges), because we have restrictive firewall rules,
 * because of ExcludeNodes, because we of path bias restrictions,
 * because they're absent from the network at present, and so on.
 *
 * As a subset of the filtered set, we keep a REACHABLE FILTERED SET
 * (also called a "usable filtered set") of those guards that we call
 * "reachable" or "maybe reachable".  A guard is reachable if we've
 * connected to it more recently than we've failed.  A guard is "maybe
 * reachable" if we have never tried to connect to it, or if we
 * failed to connect to it so long ago that we no longer think our
 * failure means it's down.
 *
 * As a persistent ordered list whose elements are taken from the
 * sampled set, we track a CONFIRMED GUARDS LIST.  A guard becomes
 * confirmed when we successfully build a circuit through it, and decide
 * to use that circuit.
 *
 * And as a final group, we have an ordered list of PRIMARY GUARDS,
 * whose elements are taken from the filtered set. We prefer
 * confirmed guards to non-confirmed guards for this list, and place
 * other restrictions on it.  The primary guards are the ones that we
 * connect to "when nothing is wrong" -- circuits through them can be used
 * immediately.
 *
 * To build circuits, we take a primary guard if possible -- or a
 * reachable filtered confirmed guard if no primary guard is possible --
 * or the first (by sampled order) filtered guard otherwise.  If the guard is
 * primary, we can use the circuit immediately on success.  Otherwise,
 * the guard is now "pending" -- we won't use its circuit unless all
 * of the circuits we're trying to build through better guards have
 * definitely failed.
 *
 * While we're building circuits, we track a little "guard state" for
 * each circuit. We use this to keep track of whether the circuit is
 * one that we can use as soon as it's done, or whether it's one that
 * we should keep around to see if we can do better.  In the latter case,
 * a periodic call to entry_guards_upgrade_waiting_circuits() will
 * eventually upgrade it.
 **/
/* DOCDOC -- expand this.
 *
 * Information invariants:
 *
 * [x] whenever a guard becomes unreachable, clear its usable_filtered flag.
 *
 * [x] Whenever a guard becomes reachable or maybe-reachable, if its filtered
 * flag is set, set its usable_filtered flag.
 *
 * [x] Whenever we get a new consensus, call update_from_consensus(). (LATER.)
 *
 * [x] Whenever the configuration changes in a relevant way, update the
 * filtered/usable flags. (LATER.)
 *
 * [x] Whenever we add a guard to the sample, make sure its filtered/usable
 * flags are set as possible.
 *
 * [x] Whenever we remove a guard from the sample, remove it from the primary
 * and confirmed lists.
 *
 * [x] When we make a guard confirmed, update the primary list, and sort them
 * by sampled order.
 *
 * [x] When we make a guard filtered or unfiltered, update the primary list.
 *
 * [x] When we are about to pick a guard, make sure that the primary list is
 * full.
 *
 * [x] When we update the confirmed list, or when we re-build the primary list
 * and detect a change, we sort those lists by sampled_idx
 *
 * [x] Before calling first_reachable_filtered_entry_guard(), make sure
 * that the filtered, primary, and confirmed flags are up-to-date.
 *
 * [x] Call entry_guard_consider_retry every time we are about to check
 * is_usable_filtered or is_reachable, and every time we set
 * is_filtered to 1.
 *
 * [x] Call entry_guards_changed_for_guard_selection() whenever we update
 * a persistent field.
