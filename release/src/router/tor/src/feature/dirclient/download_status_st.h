/** Information about our plans for retrying downloads for a downloadable
 * directory object.
 * Each type of downloadable directory object has a corresponding retry
 * <b>schedule</b>, which can be different depending on whether the object is
 * being downloaded from an authority or a mirror (<b>want_authority</b>).
 * <b>next_attempt_at</b> contains the next time we will attempt to download
 * the object.
 * For schedules that <b>increment_on</b> failure, <b>n_download_failures</b>
 * is used to determine the position in the schedule. (Each schedule is a
 * smartlist of integer delays, parsed from a CSV option.) Every time a
 * connection attempt fails, <b>n_download_failures</b> is incremented,
 * the new delay value is looked up from the schedule, and
 * <b>next_attempt_at</b> is set delay seconds from the time the previous
 * connection failed. Therefore, at most one failure-based connection can be
 * in progress for each download_status_t.
 * For schedules that <b>increment_on</b> attempt, <b>n_download_attempts</b>
 * is used to determine the position in the schedule. Every time a
 * connection attempt is made, <b>n_download_attempts</b> is incremented,
 * the new delay value is looked up from the schedule, and
 * <b>next_attempt_at</b> is set delay seconds from the time the previous
 * connection was attempted. Therefore, multiple concurrent attempted-based
 * connections can be in progress for each download_status_t.
 * After an object is successfully downloaded, any other concurrent connections
 * are terminated. A new schedule which starts at position 0 is used for
 * subsequent downloads of the same object.
