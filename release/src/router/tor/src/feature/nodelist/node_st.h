/** A node_t represents a Tor router.
 *
 * Specifically, a node_t is a Tor router as we are using it: a router that
 * we are considering for circuits, connections, and so on.  A node_t is a
 * thin wrapper around the routerstatus, routerinfo, and microdesc for a
 * single router, and provides a consistent interface for all of them.
 *
 * Also, a node_t has mutable state.  While a routerinfo, a routerstatus,
 * and a microdesc have[*] only the information read from a router
 * descriptor, a consensus entry, and a microdescriptor (respectively)...
 * a node_t has flags based on *our own current opinion* of the node.
 *
 * [*] Actually, there is some leftover information in each that is mutable.
 *  We should try to excise that.
