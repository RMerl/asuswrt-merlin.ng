/**
 * \file routerlist.c
 * \brief Code to
 * maintain and access the global list of routerinfos for known
 * servers.
 *
 * A "routerinfo_t" object represents a single self-signed router
 * descriptor, as generated by a Tor relay in order to tell the rest of
 * the world about its keys, address, and capabilities.  An
 * "extrainfo_t" object represents an adjunct "extra-info" object,
 * certified by a corresponding router descriptor, reporting more
 * information about the relay that nearly all users will not need.
 *
 * Most users will not use router descriptors for most relays.  Instead,
 * they use the information in microdescriptors and in the consensus
 * networkstatus.
 *
 * Right now, routerinfo_t objects are used in these ways:
 *  <ul>
 *   <li>By clients, in order to learn about bridge keys and capabilities.
 *     (Bridges aren't listed in the consensus networkstatus, so they
 *     can't have microdescriptors.)
 *   <li>By relays, since relays want more information about other relays
 *     than they can learn from microdescriptors. (TODO: Is this still true?)
 *   <li>By authorities, which receive them and use them to generate the
 *     consensus and the microdescriptors.
 *   <li>By all directory caches, which download them in case somebody
 *     else wants them.
 *  </ul>
 *
 * Routerinfos are mostly created by parsing them from a string, in
 * routerparse.c. We store them to disk on receiving them, and
 * periodically discard the ones we don't need. On restarting, we
 * re-read them from disk. (This also applies to extrainfo documents, if
 * we are configured to fetch them.)
 *
 * In order to keep our list of routerinfos up-to-date, we periodically
 * check whether there are any listed in the latest consensus (or in the
 * votes from other authorities, if we are an authority) that we don't
 * have.  (This also applies to extrainfo documents, if we are
 * configured to fetch them.)
 *
 * Almost nothing in Tor should use a routerinfo_t to refer directly to
 * a relay; instead, almost everything should use node_t (implemented in
 * nodelist.c), which provides a common interface to routerinfo_t,
 * routerstatus_t, and microdescriptor_t.
 *
 * <br>
 *
 * This module also has some of the functions used for choosing random
 * nodes according to different rules and weights.  Historically, they
 * were all in this module.  Now, they are spread across this module,
 * nodelist.c, and networkstatus.c.  (TODO: Fix that.)
