/** Largest value that can be passed to crypto_ope_encrypt().
 *
 *  Expressed as 2^18 because the OPE system prefers powers of two.
 *
 *  The current max value stands for about 70 hours. The rationale here is as
 *  follows: The rev counter is the time of seconds since the start of an SRV
 *  period. SRVs are useful for about 48 hours (that's how long they stick
 *  around on the consensus). Let's also add 12 hours of drift for clock skewed
 *  services that might be using an old consensus and we arrive to 60
 *  hours. The max value should be beyond that.
