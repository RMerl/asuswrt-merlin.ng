/**
 * \file crypto_rand_fast.c
 *
 * \brief A fast strong PRNG for use when our underlying cryptographic
 *   library's PRNG isn't fast enough.
 **/

/* This library is currently implemented to use the same implementation
 * technique as libottery, using AES-CTR-256 as our underlying stream cipher.
 * It's backtracking-resistant immediately, and prediction-resistant after
 * a while.
 *
 * Here's how it works:
 *
 * We generate pseudorandom bytes using AES-CTR-256.  We generate BUFLEN bytes
 * at a time.  When we do this, we keep the first SEED_LEN bytes as the key
 * and the IV for our next invocation of AES_CTR, and yield the remaining
 * BUFLEN - SEED_LEN bytes to the user as they invoke the PRNG.  As we yield
 * bytes to the user, we clear them from the buffer.
 *
 * After we have refilled the buffer RESEED_AFTER times, we mix in an
 * additional SEED_LEN bytes from our strong PRNG into the seed.
 *
 * If the user ever asks for a huge number of bytes at once, we pull SEED_LEN
 * bytes from the PRNG and use them with our stream cipher to fill the user's
 * request.
