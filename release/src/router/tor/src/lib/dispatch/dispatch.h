/**
 * \file dispatch.h
 * \brief Low-level APIs for message-passing system.
 *
 * This module implements message dispatch based on a set of short integer
 * identifiers.  For a higher-level interface, see pubsub.h.
 *
 * Each message is represented as a generic msg_t object, and is discriminated
 * by its message_id_t.  Messages are delivered by a dispatch_t object, which
 * delivers each message to its recipients by a configured "channel".
 *
 * A "channel" is a means of delivering messages.  Every message_id_t must
 * be associated with exactly one channel, identified by channel_id_t.
 * When a channel receives messages, a callback is invoked to either process
 * the messages immediately, or to cause them to be processed later.
 *
 * Every message_id_t has zero or more associated receiver functions set up in
 * the dispatch_t object.  Once the dispatch_t object is created, receivers
 * can be enabled or disabled [TODO], but not added or removed.
 *
 * Every message_id_t has an associated datatype, identified by a
 * msg_type_id_t.  These datatypes can be associated with functions to
 * (for example) free them, or format them for debugging.
 *
 * To setup a dispatch_t object, first create a dispatch_cfg_t object, and
 * configure messages with their types, channels, and receivers.  Then, use
 * dispatch_new() with that dispatch_cfg_t to create the dispatch_t object.
 *
 * (We use a two-phase contruction procedure here to enable better static
 * reasoning about publish/subscribe relationships.)
 *
 * Once you have a dispatch_t, you can queue messages on it with
 * dispatch_send*(), and cause those messages to be delivered with
 * dispatch_flush().
