 * \brief Functions to use and manipulate token buckets, used for
 *    rate-limiting on connections and globally.
 *
 * Tor uses these token buckets to keep track of bandwidth usage, and
 * sometimes other things too.
 *
 * There are two layers of abstraction here: "raw" token buckets, in which all
 * the pieces are decoupled, and "read-write" token buckets, which combine all
 * the moving parts into one.
 *
 * Token buckets may become negative.
