 *
 * \brief
 *  Implements various probability distributions.
 *  Almost all code is courtesy of Riastradh.
 *
 * \details
 * Here are some details that might help you understand this file:
 *
 * - Throughout this file, `eps' means the largest relative error of a
 *   correctly rounded floating-point operation, which in binary64
 *   floating-point arithmetic is 2^-53.  Here the relative error of a
 *   true value x from a computed value y is |x - y|/|x|.  This
 *   definition of epsilon is conventional for numerical analysts when
 *   writing error analyses.  (If your libm doesn't provide correctly
 *   rounded exp and log, their relative error is usually below 2*2^-53
 *   and probably closer to 1.1*2^-53 instead.)
 *
 *   The C constant DBL_EPSILON is actually twice this, and should
 *   perhaps rather be named ulp(1) -- that is, it is the distance from
 *   1 to the next greater floating-point number, which is usually of
 *   more interest to programmers and hardware engineers.
 *
 *   Since this file is concerned mainly with error bounds rather than
 *   with low-level bit-hacking of floating-point numbers, we adopt the
 *   numerical analysts' definition in the comments, though we do use
 *   DBL_EPSILON in a handful of places where it is convenient to use
 *   some function of eps = DBL_EPSILON/2 in a case analysis.
 *
 * - In various functions (e.g. sample_log_logistic()) we jump through hoops so
 *   that we can use reals closer to 0 than closer to 1, since we achieve much
 *   greater accuracy for floating point numbers near 0. In particular, we can
 *   represent differences as small as 10^-300 for numbers near 0, but of no
 *   less than 10^-16 for numbers near 1.

 * Some lemmas that will be used throughout this file to prove various error
 * bounds:
 *
 * Lemma 1.  If |d| <= 1/2, then 1/(1 + d) <= 2.
 *
 * Proof.  If 0 <= d <= 1/2, then 1 + d >= 1, so that 1/(1 + d) <= 1.
 * If -1/2 <= d <= 0, then 1 + d >= 1/2, so that 1/(1 + d) <= 2.  QED.
 *
 * Lemma 2. If b = a*(1 + d)/(1 + d') for |d'| < 1/2 and nonzero a, b,
 * then b = a*(1 + e) for |e| <= 2|d' - d|.
 *
 * Proof.  |a - b|/|a|
 *             = |a - a*(1 + d)/(1 + d')|/|a|
 *             = |1 - (1 + d)/(1 + d')|
 *             = |(1 + d' - 1 - d)/(1 + d')|
 *             = |(d' - d)/(1 + d')|
 *            <= 2|d' - d|, by Lemma 1,
 *
 * QED.
 *
 * Lemma 3.  For |d|, |d'| < 1/4,
 *
 *     |log((1 + d)/(1 + d'))| <= 4|d - d'|.
 *
 * Proof.  Write
 *
 *     log((1 + d)/(1 + d'))
 *      = log(1 + (1 + d)/(1 + d') - 1)
 *      = log(1 + (1 + d - 1 - d')/(1 + d')
 *      = log(1 + (d - d')/(1 + d')).
 *
 * By Lemma 1, |(d - d')/(1 + d')| < 2|d' - d| < 1, so the Taylor
 * series of log(1 + x) converges absolutely for (d - d')/(1 + d'),
 * and thus we have
 *
 *     |log(1 + (d - d')/(1 + d'))|
 *      = |\sum_{n=1}^\infty ((d - d')/(1 + d'))^n/n|
 *     <= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |(d - d')/(1 + d')|^n/n
 *     <= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |2(d' - d)|^n/n
 *     <= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |2(d' - d)|^n
 *      = 1/(1 - |2(d' - d)|)
 *     <= 4|d' - d|,
 *
 * QED.
 *
 * Lemma 4.  If 1/e <= 1 + x <= e, then
 *
 *     log(1 + (1 + d) x) = (1 + d') log(1 + x)
 *
 * for |d'| < 8|d|.
 *
 * Proof.  Write
 *
 *     log(1 + (1 + d) x)
 *     = log(1 + x + x*d)
 *     = log((1 + x) (1 + x + x*d)/(1 + x))
 *     = log(1 + x) + log((1 + x + x*d)/(1 + x))
 *     = log(1 + x) (1 + log((1 + x + x*d)/(1 + x))/log(1 + x)).
 *
 * The relative error is bounded by
 *
 *     |log((1 + x + x*d)/(1 + x))/log(1 + x)|
 *     <= 4|x + x*d - x|/|log(1 + x)|, by Lemma 3,
 *      = 4|x*d|/|log(1 + x)|
 *      < 8|d|,
 *
 * since in this range 0 < 1 - 1/e < x/log(1 + x) <= e - 1 < 2.  QED.

     *
     * Theorem.  If 0 <= t < 1, then the floating-point
     * evaluation of a + (b - a) t is bounded in [a, b].
     *
     * Lemma 1.  If 0 <= t < 1 is a floating-point number,
     * then for any normal floating-point number x except
     * the smallest in magnitude, |round(x*t)| < |x|.
     *
     * Proof.  WLOG, assume x >= 0.  Since the rounding
     * function and t |---> x*t are nondecreasing, their
     * composition t |---> round(x*t) is also
     * nondecreasing, so it suffices to consider the
     * largest floating-point number below 1, in particular
     * t = 1 - ulp(1)/2.
     *
     * Case I: If x is a power of two, then the next
     * floating-point number below x is x - ulp(x)/2 = x -
     * x*ulp(1)/2 = x*(1 - ulp(1)/2) = x*t, so, since x*t
     * is a floating-point number, multiplication is exact,
     * and thus round(x*t) = x*t < x.
     *
     * Case II: If x is not a power of two, then the
     * greatest lower bound of real numbers rounded to x is
     * x - ulp(x)/2 = x - ulp(T(x))/2 = x - T(x)*ulp(1)/2,
     * where T(X) is the largest power of two below x.
     * Anything below this bound is rounded to a
     * floating-point number smaller than x, and x*t = x*(1
     * - ulp(1)/2) = x - x*ulp(1)/2 < x - T(x)*ulp(1)/2
     * since T(x) < x, so round(x*t) < x*t < x.  QED.
     *
     * Lemma 2.  If x and y are subnormal, then round(x +
     * y) = x + y.
     *
     * Proof.  It is a matter of adding the significands,
     * since if we treat subnormals as having an implicit
     * zero bit before the `binary' point, their exponents
     * are all the same.  There is at most one carry/borrow
     * bit, which can always be acommodated either in a
     * subnormal, or, at largest, in the implicit one bit
     * of a normal.
     *
     * Lemma 3.  Let x and y be floating-point numbers.  If
     * round(x - y) is subnormal or zero, then it is equal
     * to x - y.
     *
     * Proof.  Case I (equal): round(x - y) = 0 iff x = y;
     * hence if round(x - y) = 0, then round(x - y) = 0 = x
     * - y.
     *
     * Case II (subnormal/subnormal): If x and y are both
     * subnormal, this follows directly from Lemma 2.
     *
     * Case IIIa (normal/subnormal): If x is normal and y
     * is subnormal, then x and y must share sign, or else
     * x - y would be larger than x and thus rounded to
     * normal.  If s is the smallest normal positive
     * floating-point number, |x| < 2s since by
     * construction 2s - |y| is normal for all subnormal y.
     * This means that x and y must have the same exponent,
     * so the difference is the difference of significands,
     * which is exact.
     *
     * Case IIIb (subnormal/normal): Same as case IIIa for
     * -(y - x).
     *
     * Case IV (normal/normal): If x and y are both normal,
     * then they must share sign, or else x - y would be
     * larger than x and thus rounded to normal.  Note that
     * |y| < 2|x|, for if |y| >= 2|x|, then |x| - |y| <=
     * -|x| but -|x| is normal like x.  Also, |x|/2 < |y|:
     * if |x|/2 is subnormal, it must hold because y is
     * normal; if |x|/2 is normal, then |x|/2 >= s, so
     * since |x| - |y| < s,
     *
     *  |x|/2 = |x| - |x|/2 <= |x| - s <= |y|;
     *
     * that is, |x|/2 < |y| < 2|x|, so by the Sterbenz
     * lemma, round(x - y) = x - y.  QED.
     *
     * Proof of theorem.  WLOG, assume 0 <= a <= b.  Since
     * round(a + round(round(b - a)*t) is nondecreasing in
     * t and attains a at 0, the lower end of the bound is
     * trivial; we must show the upper end of the bound
     * strictly.  It suffices to show this for the largest
     * floating-point number below 1, namely 1 - ulp(1)/2.
     *
     * Case I: round(b - a) is normal.  Then it is at most
     * the smallest floating-point number above b - a.  By
     * Lemma 1, round(round(b - a)*t) < round(b - a).
     * Since the inequality is strict, and since
     * round(round(b - a)*t) is a floating-point number
     * below round(b - a), and since there are no
     * floating-point numbers between b - a and round(b -
     * a), we must have round(round(b - a)*t) < b - a.
     * Then since y |---> round(a + y) is nondecreasing, we
     * must have
     *
     *  round(a + round(round(b - a)*t))
     *  <= round(a + (b - a))
     *   = round(b) = b.
     *
     * Case II: round(b - a) is subnormal.  In this case,
     * Lemma 1 falls apart -- we are not guaranteed the
     * strict inequality.  However, by Lemma 3, the
     * difference is exact: round(b - a) = b - a.  Thus,
     *
     *  round(a + round(round(b - a)*t))
     *  <= round(a + round((b - a)*t))
     *  <= round(a + (b - a))
     *   = round(b)
     *   = b,
     *
     * QED.
