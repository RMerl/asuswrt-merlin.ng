 * \brief Functions and types for monotonic times.
 *
 * monotime_* functions try to provide a high-resolution monotonic timer with
 * something the best resolution the system provides.  monotime_coarse_*
 * functions run faster (if the operating system gives us a way to do that)
 * but produce a less accurate timer: accuracy will probably be on the order
 * of tens of milliseconds.
 */

/* Q: When should I use monotonic time?
 *
 * A: If you need a time that never decreases, use monotonic time. If you need
 * to send a time to a user or another process, or store a time, use the
 * wall-clock time.
 *
 * Q: Should you use monotime or monotime_coarse as your source?
 *
 * A: Generally, you get better precision with monotime, but better
 * performance with monotime_coarse.
 *
 * Q: What is a "monotonic" time, exactly?
 *
 * A: Monotonic times are strictly non-decreasing. The difference between any
 * previous monotonic time, and the current monotonic time, is always greater
 * than *or equal to* zero.
 * Zero deltas happen more often:
 *  - on Windows (due to an OS bug),
 *  - when using monotime_coarse, or on systems with low-resolution timers,
 *  - on platforms where we emulate monotonic time using wall-clock time, and
 *  - when using time units that are larger than nanoseconds (due to
 *    truncation on division).
 *
 * Q: Should you use monotime_t or monotime_coarse_t directly? Should you use
 *    usec? msec? "stamp units?"
 *
 * A: Using monotime_t and monotime_coarse_t directly is most time-efficient,
 * since no conversion needs to happen.  But they can potentially use more
 * memory than you would need for a usec/msec/"stamp unit" count.
 *
 * Converting to usec or msec on some platforms, and working with them in
 * general, creates a risk of doing a 64-bit division.  64-bit division is
 * expensive on 32-bit platforms, which still do exist.
 *
 * The "stamp unit" type is designed to give a type that is cheap to convert
 * from monotime_coarse, has resolution of about 1-2ms, and fits nicely in a
 * 32-bit integer.  Its downside is that it does not correspond directly
 * to a natural unit of time.
 *
 * There is not much point in using "coarse usec" or "coarse nsec", since the
 * current coarse monotime implementations give you on the order of
 * milliseconds of precision.
 *
 * Q: So, what backends is monotime_coarse using?
 *
 * A: Generally speaking, it uses "whatever monotonic-ish time implementation
 * does not require a context switch."  The various implementations provide
 * this by having a view of the current time in a read-only memory page that
 * is updated with a frequency corresponding to the kernel's tick count.
 *
 * On Windows, monotime_coarse uses GetCount64() [or GetTickCount() on
 * obsolete systems].  MSDN claims that the resolution is "typically in the
 * range of 10-16 msec", but it has said that for years.  Storing
 * monotime_coarse_t uses 8 bytes.
 *
 * On OSX/iOS, monotime_coarse uses uses mach_approximate_time() where
 * available, and falls back to regular monotime. The precision is not
 * documented, but the implementation is open-source: it reads from a page
 * that the kernel updates. Storing monotime_coarse_t uses 8 bytes.
 *
 * On unixy systems, monotime_coarse uses clock_gettime() with
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE where available, and falls back to CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
 * It typically uses vdso tricks to read from a page that the kernel updates.
 * Its precision fixed, but you can get it with clock_getres(): on my Linux
 * desktop, it claims to be 1 msec, but it will depend on the system HZ
 * setting. Storing monotime_coarse_t uses 16 bytes.
 *
 * [TODO: Try CLOCK_MONOTONIC_FAST on foobsd.]
 *
 * Q: What backends is regular monotonic time using?
 *
 * A: In general, regular monotime uses something that requires a system call.
 * On platforms where system calls are cheap, you win!  Otherwise, you lose.
 *
 * On Windows, monotonic time uses QuereyPerformanceCounter.  Storing
 * monotime_t costs 8 bytes.
 *
 * On OSX/Apple, monotonic time uses mach_absolute_time.  Storing
 * monotime_t costs 8 bytes.
 *
 * On unixy systems, monotonic time uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC.  Storing
 * monotime_t costs 16 bytes.
 *
 * Q: Tell me about the costs of converting to a 64-bit nsec, usec, or msec
 *    count.
 *
 * A: Windows, coarse: Cheap, since it's all multiplication.
 *
 * Windows, precise: Expensive on 32-bit: it needs 64-bit division.
 *
 * Apple, all: Expensive on 32-bit: it needs 64-bit division.
 *
 * Unixy, all: Fairly cheap, since the only division required is dividing
 * tv_nsec 1000, and nanoseconds-per-second fits in a 32-bit value.
 *
 * All, "timestamp units": Cheap everywhere: it never divides.
 *
 * Q: This is only somewhat related, but how much precision could I hope for
 *    from a libevent time?
 *
 * A: Actually, it's _very_ related if you're timing in order to have a
 * timeout happen.
 *
 * On Windows, it uses select: you could in theory have a microsecond
 * resolution, but it usually isn't that accurate.
 *
 * On OSX, iOS, and BSD, you have kqueue: You could in theory have a nanosecond
 * resolution, but it usually isn't that accurate.
 *
 * On Linux, you have epoll: It has a millisecond resolution.  Some recent
 * Libevents can also use timerfd for higher resolution if
 * EVENT_BASE_FLAG_PRECISE_TIMER is set: Tor doesn't set that flag.
