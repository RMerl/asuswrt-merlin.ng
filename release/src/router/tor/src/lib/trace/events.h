/*
 * The following defines a generic event tracing function name that has to be
 * used to trace events in the code base.
 *
 * That generic function is then defined by a event tracing framework. For
 * instance, the "log debug" framework sends all trace events to log_debug()
 * which is defined in src/trace/debug.h which can only be enabled at compile
 * time (--enable-event-tracing-debug).
 *
 * By default, every trace events in the code base are replaced by a NOP. See
 * doc/HACKING/Tracing.md for more information on how to use event tracing or
 * add events.
