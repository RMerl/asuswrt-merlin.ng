HISTORY OF MICROSOFT NTFS BY TUXERA

NTFS 3023.8.30.5

- Work around kernel bug with invalid mount options.
- Fix incorrect error from fallocate() system call when cluster size of the
  volume is larger than the PAGE_SIZE of the CPU.

NTFS 3023.8.30.2

- Add support for kernels up to 6.5.
- Fix bug when mounting a corrupt file system with an empty $MFT system file.
- Build fixes.

NTFS 3022.5.18.12

- Relax MFT record check for USA offset in $MFT to improve compatibility with
  existing volumes.
- Add support for kernels 5.15.52+ and 5.17+ with CONFIG_USER_NS=y enabled in
  the kernel configuration.

NTFS 3022.5.18.8

- Update supported kernel versions. Now support kernels up to 5.16.
- Improve the time in which dirty data is pushed to disk on rename operation.
- Fix out of memory condition when restoring large files.
- Fix bug causing zero tails to be returned when doing concurrent reads and
  writes to the same file.
- Fix driver rare crash resulting from a corrupt metadata related to extents 
  belonging to a file with a combination of system calls.
- Fix boundary checks in splice_write() which could result in kernel crash if
  there was an overflow over 2^63-1.
- Fix file size overflow boundary check when size approaches 2^63-1 which was
  resulting in a kernel bug being hit.
- Fix rare deadlocks/crashes when attempting to add a new entry to a directory
  when the volume is full.
- Fix crash when writing to a fragmented file and the volume runs out of space.

NTFS 3021.4.23.18

- Documentation now provided in README-NTFS.TXT and HISTORY-NTFS.TXT.
- Includes security update and is recommended for all users.
- Update supported kernel versions. Now support kernels up to 5.12.
- Add support for kernel symbol namespaces to enable build on latest Android 12
  kernel 5.10.
- Fix boundary checks in splice_write() which could result in kernel crash if
  there was an overflow over 2^63-1.
- Fix file size overflow boundary check when size approaches 2^63-1 which was
  resulting in a kernel bug being hit.
- Fix rare deadlocks/crashes when attempting to add a new entry to a directory
  when the volume is full.
- Treat stale references through lookup as no entries.
- Fix very unlikely but potential integer overflow.
- Fix crash when writing to a fragmented file and the volume runs out of space.
- Improve behaviour when allocating large files under memory pressure.
- Fix a regression in driver which happens in workloads where multiple threads
  are doing I/O in parallel to same inode. Some of those threads extend the
  allocation and some might shrink the allocation.

NTFS 3021.4.23.8
  
- Update supported kernel versions. Now support kernels up to 5.8.  
- Add consistency checks for MFT record and attributes.
- Make the driver interruptible while extending initialized size of a file.
- Fix a rare bug which happens when volume is full but $MFT file has space and
  we are creating a long symlink which doesn't fit in a single MFT record.
- Implement getxattr() for "system.ntfs_times".
- Add sanity check for volume label attribute.
- Make "utf8" the default character set. New mount option "-o noutf8" to disable
  the default behaviour during mount time.
- Fix missing sync between file attributes readonly flag and writeable
  permission when the readonly flag is modified using the
  FAT_IOCTL_SET_ATTRIBUTES ioctl.
- Extend maximum cluster size to 2MiB.
- Fix a rare bug in extension of volume bitmap when volume has specific size and
  it runs out of space.
- Fix a bug where the inode would not be marked dirty in case we are updating
  the initialized size of a non-resident inode without updating its file size.
- Fix rare panic on unplug USB drive.
- Disable use of movable memory on kernels with CONFIG_CMA=y.
- Update documentation.
- Fix error message after Windows hibernation status check.
- Significantly improve performance when allocation small files.
- Add support for 2 new ioctl() FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES and
  FAT_IOCTL_SET_ATTRIBUTES.
- Add configuration to make driver read only.
- Significantly increase the maximum number of files user can create on NTFS
  volume.
