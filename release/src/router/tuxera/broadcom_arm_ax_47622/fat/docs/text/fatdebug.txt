FATDEBUG(8)                 System Manager's Manual                FATDEBUG(8)



NAME
       fatdebug - Create a metadata dump of a FAT volume suitable for bug
       reporting.

SYNOPSIS
       fatdebug device|image

DESCRIPTION
       fatdebug will efficiently extract all metadata relevant for debugging
       from a FAT volume and dump it to standard output.  It works at disk
       sector level and copies only the metadata of the FAT volume (so the
       resulting output is relatively small).

       fatdebug is mostly useful when sending bug reports to FAT developers.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       Dump FAT file system metadata on /dev/sda1 to a local image file:

              fatdebug /dev/sda1 > sda1.img

       Dump FAT file system metadata on /dev/sda1 to a bzip2-compressed local
       image file:

              fatdebug /dev/sda1 | bzip2 > sda1.img

       Dump FAT file system metadata to a remote host, using ssh. Please note
       that ssh may ask for a password!

              fatdebug /dev/sda1 | ssh host 'cat > sda1.img'


PLEASE NOTE
       fatdebug currently does not support FAT12 volumes.
