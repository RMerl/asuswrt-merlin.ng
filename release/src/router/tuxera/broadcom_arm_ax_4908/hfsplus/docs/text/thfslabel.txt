NAME
       thfslabel - Display/change the label on an HFS+ file system.

SYNOPSIS
       thfslabel [options] device [new-label]

DESCRIPTION
       thfslabel will display or change the file system label on the HFS+ file
       system located on device.

       If the optional argument new-label is not present, thfslabel will
       simply print the current file system label as a UTF-8 string.

       If the optional argument new-label is present, then thfslabel will set
       the file system label to be the string new-label, given in UTF-8
       format.
       HFS+ file system labels can be at most 255 UTF-16 code units of
       decomposed Unicode long; if new-label is longer than 255 UTF-16 code
       units of decomposed Unicode, thfslabel will truncate it and print a
       warning message. Note that the string in new-label will be decomposed
       automatically by thfslabel.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that thfslabel accepts.

       --output-mode=[mode]
              Specify the output mode when printing the volume label.
              Currently the supported output modes are raw and composed.
              Raw mode means that the label is converted from UTF-16 to UTF-8
              without any further transformation. This implies that the output
              will be in decomposed Unicode since this is how strings are
              stored in HFS+.
              Composed mode means that the label is converted from the on-disk
              decomposed form into composed Unicode, which is what most
              operating systems expect (Mac OS X being the exception).
              The default behaviour (when this option is not given) is the
              behaviour of the composed option.
