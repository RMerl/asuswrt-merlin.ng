NAME
       fatfsck - check and repair a FAT volume

SYNOPSIS
       fatfsck [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       fatfsck will check a FAT volume for errors, and optionally correct
       them.  Run fatfsck without arguments for a full list of options.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that fatfsck accepts.  Nearly all
       options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by - and
       the long name is preceded by --.

       -b, --basic
              Do only a basic file system check or repair. This option limits
              fatfsck to checking/repairing the boot region, FAT and the root
              directory. All other directories and allocations are ignored.
              This is useful when you want to do a fast check/repair which
              makes sure that the volume will mount properly and that the root
              directory will be accessible.

       -p, --probe
              Probe for a FAT file system. This runs some tests on the device
              to check if the file system is FAT.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppresses informational messages. Only error/warning messages
              and the final summary is displayed during execution.

       -r, --repair
              Repair on-disk inconsistencies encountered.

       -a, --automatic-repair
              If the volume is marked dirty, then repair on-disk
              inconsistencies encountered (equivalent to the -r/--repair
              option). Otherwise exit immediately with no action.

       -s, --strict
              Turns on strict checking. This includes checking things that are
              not normally required to make sure the volume follows FAT
              specifications. This may increase the execution time for
              fatfsck.

       -t, --timeout SECONDS
              Timeout in seconds before fatfsck will abort the volume
              check/repair. If specified, this sets an upper limit on the
              execution time of fatfsck. After the timeout occurs, fatfsck
              will clear all its pending tasks and return as soon as possible.
              As a special case, a timeout value of 0 means that there is no
              timeout, i.e. it is equivalent to not specifying the timeout
              option at all.

       -B, --progress-fd FD
              Enables progress reporting through the dedicated file descriptor
              FD using the same format as the one emitted by e2fsck's -C
              option.

       --cp CODEPAGE
              Use the given code page to decode the volume label and short
              file names. The following code pages are supported: 437, 737,
              775, 850, 852, 855, 857, 860, 861, 862, 863, 864, 865, 866, 869,
              874, 932, 936, 949, 950. The default is 437.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose output. This makes fatfsck print more information about
              what it's doing, for instance which directory/file it's
              currently processing.

EXIT STATUS
       0: Success. fatfsck did what it was instructed to do successfully.

       1: Unknown error. Error came from outside fatfsck (libraries, operating
       system kernel, ...).

       2: Invalid arguments. An error was detected when parsing the options.

       3: FAT volume errors were detected (when checking) or could not be
       repaired (when repairing)

PLEASE NOTE
       fatfsck currently does not support checking and repairing of FAT12
       volumes.
