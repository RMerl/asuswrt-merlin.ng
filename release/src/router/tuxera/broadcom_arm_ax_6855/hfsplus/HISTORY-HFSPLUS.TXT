HISTORY OF TUXERA HFSPLUS

HFSPLUS 3021.12.17

- Documentation now provided in README-HFSPLUS.TXT and HISTORY-HFSPLUS.TXT.
- Fix error handling during B-tree node split to correctly free the new node.
- Update supported kernel versions. Now support kernels up to 5.15.
- Work around user space problem causing the root directory of a freshly 
  formatted volume to be inaccessible on 32-bit Linux kernels >= 4.18.
- Make splice() system call work for kernels >= 5.10.
- Remove error message when there is not enough free space to extend a file.
- Fix possible file system corruption when a large extended attribute is
  created.
- Fix corruption of file birth time (as returned by statx()) when creating hard
  links.
- Fix direct IO read beyond end of file in kernels < 4.1.17.
- Fixes fallocate() on kernels < 4.9 on which it could cause "No such device"
  error.
- Fix crash due to race condition when creating b-tree nodes.

HFSPLUS 3021.10.7

- Update supported kernel versions. Now support kernels up to 5.14.
- Improve logic and add warnings when using utf8 together with nls= options.
  Automatically disable default utf8 option if nls= option was specified at
  mount time and print a warning.
- Documentation update.
- Use "utf8" option by default for mount. It enables extended Unicode characters
  like Emojis for example. The mount option noutf8 can be used to disable the
  new default.
- Fix crash happened when deleting extended attributes.
- Make special ".HFS+ Private Directory Data" directory hidden.
- Fix Unicode issue with unsupported characters above U+10000.

HFSPLUS 3017.6.20

- Update supported kernel versions. Now support kernels up to 4.9.
- Add kernel header mismatch warning message on module load.
- Fix ctime not properly updated.
- Init posix uid, gid and mode for the new inode.
- When reading a directory from disk use the stored mode instead of wiping out
  various permissions.
- When mount with "nomode" wipe out the extended permissions bits.
- Fix to make chmod/chown/chgrp work on directories.
- Fix bug when POSIX read command returns an error when the software requests
  more data than there is remaining in the file.
- Check whether string conversion fails and if so abort the operation. This
  fixes for example the case when the name is too long now creating such a file
  returns an error ENAMETOOLONG instead of succeeding.
- Fix B-tree corruption when a new record is inserted at position 0 in the node
  in hfs_brec_insert().
- Fix NULL pointer de-reference while clearing BTree node.
- Fix "unused node is not erased" error.
- Improve write performance with in-memory permissions.
- Add nomode mount option (-o nomode). With "-o nomode" mount option all
  permissions set from Mac OSX are retained. With in-memory permission
  determined through uid, gid, fmask, dmask. All new files/directories created
  have uid=gid=99 and mode = S_IRWXUGO & ~(sbi->umask) (or fmask, dmask,
  depending on file, dir).
- Fix expanding truncate when not enough available space.
- NUL terminate volume label.
