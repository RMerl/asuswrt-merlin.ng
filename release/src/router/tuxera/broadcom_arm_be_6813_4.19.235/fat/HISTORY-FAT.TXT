HISTORY OF MICROSOFT FAT BY TUXERA

FAT 3021.3.22.24

- Documentation now provided in README-FAT.TXT and HISTORY-FAT.TXT.
- Fix deadlock in fsync() on kernels < 3.1.
- Fix very rare deadlock during inode eviction.
- Fix failsafety bug when deleting multiple files from the same directory which
  could result in cross links.
- Fix bug on big endian systems causing files to be inaccessible.
- Update supported kernel versions. Now support kernels up to 5.10.
- Make the driver interruptible while extending initialized size of a file.
- Fix a rare race condition which could lead to an unexpected partial write to a
  regular file.
- Improve logic and add warnings when using utf8 together with nls= options.
  Automatically disable default utf8 option if nls= option was specified at
  mount time and print a warning.
- Output nls= instead of iocharset= in /proc/mounts.
- Fix FITRIM ioctl in case it called with a length larger than the volume.

FAT 3021.3.22.7

- Fix multiple failsafe related issues found during internal testing.
- New mount options: "-o tz=UTC": this option causes the driver to assume that
  the system time zone is UTC. New option "-o time_offset=minutes" to set time
  zone offset used when converting timestamps between local time which is used
  on disk and UTC which is used by Linux.
- New mount option "-o flush_inode_bytes=<size_with_suffix>" to force flush on
  inode cache after specified amount of data has been written to inode.
- New mount option "-o flush_inode_interval=<milliseconds>" to set specified
  interval to force flush of inode cache.
- Make "utf8" the default character set. New mount option "-o noutf8" to disable
  the default behaviour during mount time.
- Update documentation.
- Added support for NFS exporting.
- Fix a bug in time handling which cause file created time not shown in Windows
  Explorer.
- Improve handling of direct i/o for kernel processes.
- Fix rare bug in handling very small size rename journal.
- Disable use of movable memory on kernels with CONFIG_CMA=y.
- Fix for exFAT directories which contain invalid directory entry sets so that
  such directories can be deleted.
- Fix bug which could cause file system mount to get stuck. Issue was found on a
  kernel configured with BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT when a freshly formatted SD card
  was inserted.
- Improve stability when handling unplug related i/o error.
- Reduce error logging in case block device is unplugged.
- Improve stability in some scenarios related to case when a volume is remounted
  read-only due to errors=remount-ro mount option.
- Improve fdatasync behaviour.
- Switch string printed for nocache mount option in /proc/mounts to be
  "iostreaming" instead of "nocache".
- Add configuration to boost directory lookup by pining in memory number of
  inodes.
- Add configuration to minimize resource usage even more for low cpu platform.
- Add stability fix in TUXERA_GET_VOLUME_LABEL ioctl.
- Add configuration to tune hot files.
- Fix deadlock causing hang during file truncation on some kernels.
- Fix rare crash in one hibernation scenario.
- Add configuration to use allocate without __GFP_MOVABLE.
- Add configuration to tell allocator always allocate sequentially. Add
  configuration to set minimum preallocation size.
- Fixed a rare race condition when unmounting volume.
- Fixed crash which could happened during rename operation on some corrupted
  volumes.
- Discard preallocation in case a file is closed but not all the data yet
  written.
- Significant performance improvements when creating a large number of small
  files within a single directory.
- Add a new ioctl() TUXERA_GET_CLUSTER_SIZE which returns the cluster size in
  bytes.
- Always return -EROFS from all write related calls in case filesystem has been
  remounted read-only.
- Add configuration to force inode numbers to be 32-bit on 64-bit systems. Add
  two new mount options - inode32/inode64.
- Attempt to fix very rare kernel crash during file copy. We fixed imbalance by
  adding missed call to blk_finish_plug to a code path which had blk_start_plug
  without a blk_finish_plug.
- Stop printing invalid error message about Unicode characters can't be
  converted as it really is not an error in this use case.
- Add configuration which makes memory shrinker optional.
- Add configuration to enable driver use default system readahead for removable
  volumes <= 32GiB.
- Add support for r/w mount even if the volume size is larger than the actual
  device size. Correctness enforced by operating with in-memory truncated number
  of sectors/clusters which fits the device size. Any access outside the device
  size will give an i/o error and a warning message to the kernel log.
- Add configuration option to have both pid and process name printed in log.
- Add configuration to enable start refusing read i/o immediately when device
  goes away.
- Add option to make updating the file size on end of write: boolean mount
  option -o update_size_on_end_of_write.
- Fix crash if doing concurrent truncate at the same time as reading.
- Fix rare crash due to broken locking in some truncate scenarios.
- Fix discard/trim requests on block devices where the sector size is not 512
  bytes.
