   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for \'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }\', c99 incorrectly complains
   \'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function\'.
   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.

   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
   on configurations that mistakenly use \'static inline\' to implement
   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
   from calling static functions (ISO C 99 section 6.7.4.(3).
   This bug is known to occur on:

     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html

     DragonFly; see
     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log

     FreeBSD; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.

   GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  It defines a macro
   __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ to indicate this situation or a macro
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate the opposite situation.
   GCC 4.2 with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements the GNU C inline
   semantics but warns, unless -fgnu89-inline is used:
     warning: C99 inline functions are not supported; using GNU89
     warning: to disable this warning use -fgnu89-inline or the gnu_inline function attribute
   It defines a macro __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate this situation.
