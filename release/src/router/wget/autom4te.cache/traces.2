     * All functions that it calls should be marked _GL_ASYNC_SAFE as well,

       section 2.4.3.  Note that malloc(), sprintf(), and fwrite(), in

     * All memory locations (variables and struct fields) that these functions
       access must be marked \'volatile\'.  This holds for both read and write
       accesses.  Otherwise the compiler might optimize away stores to and
       reads from such locations that occur in the program, depending on its
       data flow analysis.  For example, when the program contains a loop

           while (!signal_occurred)
             ;
       the compiler is allowed to transform this into an endless loop if the
       variable \'signal_occurred\' is not declared \'volatile\'.
   Additionally, recall that:
     * A signal handler should not modify errno (except if it is a handler
       for a fatal signal and ends by raising the same signal again, thus
       provoking the termination of the process).  If it invokes a function

   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for \'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }\', c99 incorrectly complains
   \'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function\'.
   This bug was observed with Oracle Developer Studio 12.6
   (Sun C 5.15 SunOS_sparc 2017/05/30).

   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
   on configurations that mistakenly use \'static inline\' to implement
   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
   from calling static functions (ISO C 99 section 6.7.4.(3).
   This bug is known to occur on:

     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html

     DragonFly; see
     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/clang-master-potential/20141111_102002/logs/ah-tty-0.3.12.log

     FreeBSD; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.

   GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  It defines a macro
   __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ to indicate this situation or a macro
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate the opposite situation.
   GCC 4.2 with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements the GNU C inline
   semantics but warns, unless -fgnu89-inline is used:
     warning: C99 inline functions are not supported; using GNU89
     warning: to disable this warning use -fgnu89-inline or the gnu_inline function attribute
   It defines a macro __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate this situation.
