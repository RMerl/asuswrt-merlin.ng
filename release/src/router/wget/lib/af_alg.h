/* Compute a message digest of a memory region.

   The memory region starts at BUFFER and is LEN bytes long.

   ALG is the message digest algorithm; see the file /proc/crypto.

   RESBLOCK points to a block of HASHLEN bytes, for the result.
   HASHLEN must be the length of the message digest, in bytes, in particular:

      alg    | hashlen
      -------+--------
      md5    | 16
      sha1   | 20
      sha224 | 28
      sha256 | 32
      sha384 | 48
      sha512 | 64

   If successful, fill RESBLOCK and return 0.
   Upon failure, return a negated error number.  */

/* Compute a message digest of data read from STREAM.

   STREAM is an open file stream.  The last operation on STREAM should
   not be 'ungetc', and if STREAM is also open for writing it should
   have been fflushed since its last write.  Read from the current
   position to the end of STREAM.  Handle regular files efficiently.
