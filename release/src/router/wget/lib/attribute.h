   macros used within Gnulib.  */

/* These attributes can be placed in two ways:
     - At the start of a declaration (i.e. even before storage-class
       specifiers!); then they apply to all entities that are declared
       by the declaration.
     - Immediately after the name of an entity being declared by the
       declaration; then they apply to that entity only.  */

/* This file defines two types of attributes:
   * C23 standard attributes.  These have macro names that do not begin with

   * Selected GCC attributes; see:
