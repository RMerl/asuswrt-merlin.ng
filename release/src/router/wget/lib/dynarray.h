#ifndef _GL_DYNARRAY_H

/* Before including this file, you need to define:

   DYNARRAY_STRUCT
      The struct tag of dynamic array to be defined.

   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT
      The type name of the element type.  Elements are copied
      as if by memcpy, and can change address as the dynamic
      array grows.

   DYNARRAY_PREFIX
      The prefix of the functions which are defined.

   The following parameters are optional:

   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE
      DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE (E) is evaluated to deallocate the
      contents of elements. E is of type  DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *.

   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT
      DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT (E) is evaluated to initialize a new
      element.  E is of type  DYNARRAY_ELEMENT *.
      If DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE but not DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_INIT is
      defined, new elements are automatically zero-initialized.
      Otherwise, new elements have undefined contents.

   DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE
      The size of the statically allocated array (default:
      at least 2, more elements if they fit into 128 bytes).
      Must be a preprocessor constant.  If DYNARRAY_INITIAL_SIZE is 0,
      there is no statically allocated array at, and all non-empty
      arrays are heap-allocated.

   DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE
      The name of the type which holds the final array.  If not
      defined, is PREFIX##finalize not provided.  DYNARRAY_FINAL_TYPE
      must be a struct type, with members of type DYNARRAY_ELEMENT and
      size_t at the start (in this order).

   These macros are undefined after this header file has been
   included.

   The following types are provided (their members are private to the
   dynarray implementation):

     struct DYNARRAY_STRUCT

   The following functions are provided:

/* A minimal example which provides a growing list of integers can be

   To create a three-element array with elements 1, 2, 3, use this
   code:

     struct dynarray_int dyn;
     dynarray_int_init (&dyn);
     for (int i = 1; i <= 3; ++i)
       {
         int *place = dynarray_int_emplace (&dyn);

         *place = i;
       }
     struct int_array result;
     bool ok = dynarray_int_finalize (&dyn, &result);
     assert (ok);
     assert (result.length == 3);
     assert (result.array[0] == 1);
     assert (result.array[1] == 2);
     assert (result.array[2] == 3);
     free (result.array);

   If the elements contain resources which must be freed, define
   DYNARRAY_ELEMENT_FREE appropriately, like this:

     struct str_array
     {
       char **array;
       size_t length;
     };
