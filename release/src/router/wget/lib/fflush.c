     streams and update streams in which the most recent operation was not

     When stream is "an output stream or an update stream in which the most
     recent operation was not input", POSIX and C99 requires that fflush
     writes out any buffered data, and all implementations do this.

     When stream is, however, an input stream or an update stream in
     which the most recent operation was input, C99 specifies nothing,
     and POSIX only specifies behavior if the stream is seekable.
     mingw, in particular, drops the input buffer, leaving the file
     descriptor positioned at the end of the input buffer. I.e. ftell
     (stream) is lost.  We don't want to call the implementation's
     fflush in this case.

     We test ! freading (stream) here, rather than fwriting (stream), because
     what we need to know is whether the stream holds a "read buffer", and on
     mingw this is indicated by _IOREAD, regardless of _IOWRT.  */

       1) About the file-position indicator (-> fseeko, ftello):
          The file position indicator is incremented by fgetc() and decremented
          by ungetc():
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fgetc.html>
            "... the fgetc() function shall ... advance the associated file
             position indicator for the stream ..."
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/ungetc.html>
            "The file-position indicator is decremented by each successful
             call to ungetc()..."
       2) fflush discards bytes pushed back by ungetc:
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fflush.html>
            "...any characters pushed back onto the stream by ungetc()
             or ungetwc() that have not subsequently been read from the
             stream shall be discarded..."
          This implies implicitly: fflush does not change the file position
          indicator.
       3) Effects on the file descriptor, if the file descriptor is capable of
          seeking:
          <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fflush.html>
            "...the file offset of the underlying open file description shall
             be set to the file position of the stream..."  */
