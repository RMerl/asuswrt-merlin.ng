/* Concatenate two file name components, DIR and BASE, in
   newly-allocated storage and return the result.
   The resulting file name F is such that the commands "ls F" and "(cd
   DIR; ls ./BASE)" refer to the same file.  If necessary, put
   a separator between DIR and BASE in the result.  Typically this
   separator is "/", but in rare cases it might be ".".
   In any case, if BASE_IN_RESULT is non-NULL, set
   *BASE_IN_RESULT to point to the copy of BASE at the end of the
