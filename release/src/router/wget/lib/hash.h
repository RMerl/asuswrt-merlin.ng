/* Allocate and return a new hash table, or NULL upon failure.  The initial

   may insert at least CANDIDATE different user entries before any growth of
   the hash table size occurs.  So, if have a reasonably tight a-priori upper
   bound on the number of entries you intend to insert in the hash table, you
   may save some table memory and insertion time, by specifying it here.  If
   the IS_N_BUCKETS field of the TUNING structure is true, the CANDIDATE
   argument has its meaning changed to the wanted number of buckets.

   TUNING points to a structure of user-supplied values, in case some fine
   tuning is wanted over the default behavior of the hasher.  If TUNING is
   NULL, the default tuning parameters are used instead.  If TUNING is
   provided but the values requested are out of bounds or might cause
   rounding errors, return NULL.

   The user-supplied HASHER function, when not NULL, accepts two
   arguments ENTRY and TABLE_SIZE.  It computes, by hashing ENTRY contents, a
   slot number for that entry which should be in the range 0..TABLE_SIZE-1.
   This slot number is then returned.

   The user-supplied COMPARATOR function, when not NULL, accepts two
   arguments pointing to user data, it then returns true for a pair of entries
   that compare equal, or false otherwise.  This function is internally called
   on entries which are already known to hash to the same bucket index,
   but which are distinct pointers.

   The user-supplied DATA_FREER function, when not NULL, may be later called
   with the user data as an argument, just before the entry containing the
   data gets freed.  This happens from within 'hash_free' or 'hash_clear'.
   You should specify this function only if you want these functions to free
   all of your 'data' data.  This is typically the case when your data is
   simply an auxiliary struct that you have malloc'd to aggregate several
   values.

   Set errno on failure; otherwise errno is unspecified.  */

   the return value and ENTRY.  That works only when you can have two
