/* Maximum number of bytes that it is safe to allocate as a single
   array on the stack, and that is known as a compile-time constant.
   The assumption is that we'll touch the array very quickly, or a
   temporary very near the array, provoking an out-of-memory trap.  On
   some operating systems, there is only one guard page for the stack,
   and a page size can be as small as 4096 bytes.  Subtract 64 in the
   hope that this will let the compiler touch a nearby temporary and
