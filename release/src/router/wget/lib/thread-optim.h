/* This file defines a way to optimize multithreaded code for the single-thread
   case, based on the variable '__libc_single_threaded', defined in
   glibc >= 2.32.  */

/* Typical use: In a block or function, use

     bool mt = gl_multithreaded ();
     ...
     if (mt)
       if (pthread_mutex_lock (&lock)) abort ();
     ...
     if (mt)
       if (pthread_mutex_unlock (&lock)) abort ();

   The gl_multithreaded () invocation determines whether the program currently
   is multithreaded.

   if (mt) STATEMENT executes STATEMENT in the multithreaded case, and skips
   it in the single-threaded case.

   The code between the gl_multithreaded () invocation and any use of the
   variable 'mt' must not create threads or invoke functions that may
   indirectly create threads (e.g. 'dlopen' may, indirectly through C++
   initializers of global variables in the shared library being opened,
   create threads).

   The lock here is meant to synchronize threads in the same process.  The
   same optimization cannot be applied to locks that synchronize different
   processes (e.g. through shared memory mappings).  */
