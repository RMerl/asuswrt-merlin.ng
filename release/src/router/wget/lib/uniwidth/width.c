/* The non-spacing attribute table consists of:
   * Non-spacing characters; generated from PropList.txt or
     "grep '^[^;]*;[^;]*;[^;]*;[^;]*;NSM;' UnicodeData.txt"
   * Format control characters; generated from
     "grep '^[^;]*;[^;]*;Cf;' UnicodeData.txt"
   * Zero width characters; generated from
     "grep '^[^;]*;ZERO WIDTH ' UnicodeData.txt"
   * Hangul Jamo characters that have conjoining behaviour:
       - jungseong = syllable-middle vowels
       - jongseong = syllable-final consonants
     Rationale:
     1) These characters act like combining characters. They have no
     equivalent in legacy character sets. Therefore the EastAsianWidth.txt
     file does not really matter for them; UAX #11 East Asian Width
     <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/> makes it clear that it focus
     is on compatibility with traditional Japanese layout.
     By contrast, the same glyphs without conjoining behaviour are available
     in the U+3130..U+318F block, and these characters are mapped to legacy
     character sets, and traditional Japanese layout matters for them.
     2) glibc does the same thing, see
