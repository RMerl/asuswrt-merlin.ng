/* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.

   If _Static_assert works, verify (R) uses it directly.  Similarly,
   _GL_VERIFY_TRUE works by packaging a _Static_assert inside a struct
   that is an operand of sizeof.

   The code below uses several ideas for C++ compilers, and for C
   compilers that do not support _Static_assert:

   * The first step is ((R) ? 1 : -1).  Given an expression R, of
     integral or boolean or floating-point type, this yields an
     expression of integral type, whose value is later verified to be
     constant and nonnegative.

   * Next this expression W is wrapped in a type
     struct _gl_verify_type {
       unsigned int _gl_verify_error_if_negative: W;
     }.
     If W is negative, this yields a compile-time error.  No compiler can
     deal with a bit-field of negative size.

     One might think that an array size check would have the same
     effect, that is, that the type struct { unsigned int dummy[W]; }
     would work as well.  However, inside a function, some compilers
     (such as C++ compilers and GNU C) allow local parameters and
     variables inside array size expressions.  With these compilers,
     an array size check would not properly diagnose this misuse of
     the verify macro:

       void function (int n) { verify (n < 0); }

   * For the verify macro, the struct _gl_verify_type will need to
     somehow be embedded into a declaration.  To be portable, this
     declaration must declare an object, a constant, a function, or a
     typedef name.  If the declared entity uses the type directly,
     such as in

       struct dummy {...};
       typedef struct {...} dummy;
       extern struct {...} *dummy;
       extern void dummy (struct {...} *);
       extern struct {...} *dummy (void);

     two uses of the verify macro would yield colliding declarations
     if the entity names are not disambiguated.  A workaround is to
     attach the current line number to the entity name:

       #define _GL_CONCAT0(x, y) x##y
       #define _GL_CONCAT(x, y) _GL_CONCAT0 (x, y)
       extern struct {...} * _GL_CONCAT (dummy, __LINE__);

     But this has the problem that two invocations of verify from
     within the same macro would collide, since the __LINE__ value
     would be the same for both invocations.  (The GCC __COUNTER__
     macro solves this problem, but is not portable.)

     A solution is to use the sizeof operator.  It yields a number,
     getting rid of the identity of the type.  Declarations like

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

     can be repeated.

   * Should the implementation use a named struct or an unnamed struct?
     Which of the following alternatives can be used?

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];

     In the second and sixth case, the struct type is exported to the
     outer scope; two such declarations therefore collide.  GCC warns
     about the first, third, and fourth cases.  So the only remaining
     possibility is the fifth case:

       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

   * GCC warns about duplicate declarations of the dummy function if
     -Wredundant-decls is used.  GCC 4.3 and later have a builtin
     __COUNTER__ macro that can let us generate unique identifiers for
     each dummy function, to suppress this warning.

   * This implementation exploits the fact that older versions of GCC,
     which do not support _Static_assert, also do not warn about the
     last declaration mentioned above.

   * GCC warns if -Wnested-externs is enabled and 'verify' is used
     within a function body; but inside a function, you can always
     arrange to use verify_expr instead.

   * In C++, any struct definition inside sizeof is invalid.
     Use a template type to work around the problem.  */

   'assume (R)' is a directive from the programmer telling the
   compiler that R is true so the compiler needn't generate code to
   test R.  This is why 'assume' is in verify.h: it's related to
   static checking (in this case, static checking done by the
   programmer), not dynamic checking.

   'assume (R)' can affect compilation of all the code, not just code
   that happens to be executed after the assume (R) is "executed".
   For example, if the code mistakenly does 'assert (R); assume (R);'
   the compiler is entitled to optimize away the 'assert (R)'.

   Although assuming R can help a compiler generate better code or
   diagnostics, performance can suffer if R uses hard-to-optimize
   features such as function calls not inlined by the compiler.
