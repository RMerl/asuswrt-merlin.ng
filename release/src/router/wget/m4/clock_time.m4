  # On mingw, these functions are defined in the libwinpthread library,
  # which is better avoided.  In fact, the clock_gettime function is buggy
  # in 32-bit mingw, when -D__MINGW_USE_VC2005_COMPAT is used (which Gnulib's
  # year2038 module does): It leaves the upper 32 bits of the tv_sec field
  # of the result uninitialized.

  # Solaris 2.5.1 needs -lposix4 to get the clock_gettime function.
  # Solaris 7 prefers the library name -lrt to the obsolescent name -lposix4.

  # Save and restore LIBS so e.g., -lrt, isn't added to it.  Otherwise, *all*
  # programs in the package would end up linked with that potentially-shared
  # library, inducing unnecessary run-time overhead.
