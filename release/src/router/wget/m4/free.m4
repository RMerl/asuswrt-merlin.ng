  dnl In the next release of POSIX, free must preserve errno.

  dnl https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17924
  dnl So far, we know of three platforms that do this:
  dnl * glibc >= 2.33, thanks to the fix for this bug:
  dnl   <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17924>
  dnl * OpenBSD >= 4.5, thanks to this commit:
  dnl   <https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/stdlib/malloc.c.diff?r1=1.100&r2=1.101&f=h>
  dnl * Solaris, because its malloc() implementation is based on brk(),
  dnl   not mmap(); hence its free() implementation makes no system calls.
  dnl For other platforms, you can only be sure if they state it in their
  dnl documentation, or by code inspection of the free() implementation in libc.
