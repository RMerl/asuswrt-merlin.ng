   1) The debug messages are not meant for the users to look at, but

   source comments than real program output.

   2) The messages are numerous, and yet they are random and frivolous
   ("double yuck!" and such).  There would be a lot of work with no
   gain.

   3) Finally, the debug messages are meant to be a clue for me to
   debug problems with Wget.  If I get them in a language I don't
