Typical applications for NAT is router which connect to LAN with the WAN. In LAN every network devices had a private IP(LAN IP) but there is only one public IP(WAN IP). To grant the network devices access to the Internet, the router replaces the private IP address of the sender with its own public IP address in all outgoing data packets. The router saves all necessary information in a table(NAT table) so that incoming data packets can then be assigned on the correct network device.

UserQoS_desc=From the User-defined QoS rules dropdown list, you can prioritize the network applications or devices into five levels. Based on priority level, QoS uses the following methods in sending data packets:<ul><li>Change the order of upstream network packets, which refer to the order in which packets are sent to the Internet.</li><li>Low-priority packets are disregarded to ensure the transmission of high-priority packets. The higher priority upstream packet will cause the higher priority downstream packet.</li><li>If there are no packets being sent from high-priority applications, the full transmission rate of the Internet connection is available for low-priority packets.</li></ul>

UserQoS_transferred_hint=In the 'Transferred column', set the network traffic limit (in KB) for a specific service to generate specific priorities for the service assigned to a specific port. For example, if two network clients, PC 1 and PC 2, are both accessing the Internet (set at port 80), but PC 1 exceeded the network traffic limit due to some downloading tasks, PC 1 will be given a lower priority. The Transferred column refers to the upstream and downstream traffic (outgoing and incoming network traffic) for one session. If you do not want to set the traffic limit, you can leave it blank.
