        "question": "What makes Wi-Fi 7 (wifi7, wifi 7, 802.11be) more efficient for streaming?",
        "answer": "Wi-Fi 7 enhances streaming efficiency through several advanced features. One of the key improvements is its support for Multi-Link Operation (MLO), which allows devices to connect using multiple frequency bands simultaneously. This capability reduces congestion and improves throughput, resulting in smoother streaming experiences, especially for high-definition and 4K content. Additionally, Wi-Fi 7 utilizes wider channel bandwidths, up to 320 MHz, which significantly increases data transfer rates. This means that more data can be transmitted at once, reducing buffering times and enhancing the quality of streaming services. Moreover, Wi-Fi 7 incorporates advanced modulation techniques, such as 4096-QAM, which increases the amount of data transmitted in each signal. This leads to better performance in environments with many connected devices, ensuring that streaming remains stable even when multiple users are online. Overall, these features collectively contribute to a more reliable and high-quality streaming experience, making Wi-Fi 7 particularly beneficial for users who consume media content frequently."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does my node keep disconnecting to the main router?",
        "answer": "If your node keeps disconnecting from the main router, several factors could be at play. First, check the distance between the node and the main router; if it's too far, the signal may weaken, leading to disconnections. Ensure there are minimal physical obstructions, such as walls or large furniture, that could interfere with the signal. Next, examine the Wi-Fi channel settings. If multiple devices are using the same channel, it can cause interference. Consider switching to a less congested channel or enabling automatic channel selection. Firmware updates are also crucial; ensure both the main router and the node are running the latest firmware to improve stability and performance. Additionally, check for any network configuration issues, such as IP address conflicts or incorrect settings. Lastly, if the node is overloaded with too many connected devices, it may struggle to maintain a stable connection. Reducing the number of connected devices can help improve performance.[metadata]id=10003,desc=reboot[/metadata]"

    "answer": "TXoP (Transmit Opportunity Percentage) measures the percentage of time a device has the opportunity to transmit data over the Wi-Fi network. A higher TXoP percentage indicates better network performance and efficiency for that device.TXOP usage below 20% is considered good, 20–50% is acceptable, 50–70% indicates congestion, and above 70% is poor and may cause high latency, jitter, or packet loss. (This for reference only, actual experience may vary based on environment and device capabilities)"
